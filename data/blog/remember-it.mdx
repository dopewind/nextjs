## FOR LEAH

### (AND HER BIRTHDAY THAT’S SO EASY TO

### MEMORIZE)

# FOREWORD

### DR. SANJAY GUPTA

Maybe it is because I am a neurosurgeon that people are
always asking me random questions about the brain. How
much does it weigh? What does it feel like? Is it really gray?
The question I get more than any other, though, is about
memory. Most everyone, young and old, wants to improve
their memory.

How we can optimize our memory is a difficult question
to answer. My simple reply has always been: Try and pay
more attention to those things you are truly trying to
remember. While paying attention certainly works, I knew
there had to be a better and more thoughtful strategy. That
is why I was so excited to meet Nelson Dellis.
The first thing you notice about Nelson is his size. I’m not
sure what I expected of a memory champion, but a six-foot-
six-inch mountain climber wasn’t quite it. The second thing
was his congeniality mixed with an obvious attentiveness. In
an age where it is difficult to get people to look up from
their screens, Nelson was fully engaged with me and his
surroundings. I was about to better understand why.

We were on location at a beautiful old mansion, the Swan
House in Atlanta, Georgia, and the subject of my show was,
of course, memory. Before we got into the techniques to
improve and enhance memory, I wanted to better
understand what made Nelson, a four-time USA Memory
champion and grandmaster of memory, tick.
Like many people who make changes to their physical or
mental health, Nelson was greatly moved to do so by

someone close to him. His grandmother suffered from
Alzheimer’s and eventually passed away from the disease.
This lit a fire deep inside him and inspired the tremendous
efforts he has made to improve his own memory.

It is important to know that Nelson wasn’t born with any
super memory skills; because of his family history, he may
even have an increased risk for diminishing memory. After
all, there are more than five million people affected by
Alzheimer’s disease living in the United States, with the
number increasing every year.
There is no way to overstate the memory capabilities of
Nelson Dellis. He has memorized 339 digits in five minutes
and 217 names in fifteen minutes. I went to medical school
and studied neuroscience, but I can barely remember the
names of five people at a cocktail party. Nelson is a memory
athlete and a remarkable teacher. It was time to see if any
of it could rub off on me. We settled on learning ten U.S.
presidents, specifically the twenty-fifth to thirty-fourth
presidents (because hey, why not?). The Swan House,
Nelson told me, was a fantastic location to create a
“memory palace.” With its old-time charm, nooks and
crannies, trinkety-trinkets, and the like, Nelson explained
that one could really store a lot of information in a place like
this. It is an ideal memory palace.

He walked me around the room, starting with me
imagining opening the window door to our left and seeing
Mount McKinley in the distance, with arctic, snowy air
blasting into the room. As soon as I envisioned this, I knew I
would never forget it. Not only could I see the mountain
range, but I could feel the cold air on my skin—which I can
still feel as I write this—a constant reminder that William
McKinley was the twenty-fifth president of the United States.
Just to the left of that window door was a small bar with a
large teddy bear standing there, sipping a drink—Teddy
Roosevelt, of course. A large raft floating on a globe

represented our twenty-seventh president, William Howard
Taft; and a bright yellow tennis ball with the name Wilson on
it—for Woodrow Wilson—smashing through a grandfather
clock in the back corner of the room.

It took just a few minutes for me to encode the ten
presidents into images and place them around the memory
palace. At the time, I thought there was no way these
images would stick in my brain, but it has been a year since
my tour of the memory palace, and I am now confident I will
always remember them. Even Nelson would agree I was
exhibiting a fantastic memory, and it only took several
minutes of him training me to get there.
As you dive into this fun and zany book of memory
techniques, keep in mind the early lesson that we too often
forget: pay attention, fully and thoroughly. You will not only
remember better, but you will also experience and enjoy life
more. This book will make remarkable memory an ordinary
part of your life, and you will not find a more engaging
teacher than Nelson Dellis. I have been using the techniques
in this book every day, and if you do the same you will

#### never again forget to Remember It!

CHAPTER ONE
```

# My Story and Why You Should

# Listen to Me

#### Whenever I try to remember, I forget.

##### —WINNIE THE POOH

Remember the last time you walked out of a meeting,
correctly recalling everyone’s names as you shake their
hands goodbye? Remember the last time you went online to
check that bank account you hardly ever use anymore, and
you nailed the password—uppercases, numerals, and all—on
the first try? Remember the last time someone asked you,
“What are you doing next Tuesday?” and you recited your
entire schedule and to-do list for that day off the top of your
head? If you don’t remember, it’s probably because you

#### didn’t remember—and if you didn’t remember, it’s probably

because you’re one of the billions of humans on this planet
with an imperfect memory.\* Most of us have grown
accustomed to the frustration of memory lapses, and the
little things we do to get by in spite of them: calling
everyone “dude”; using the same simple password on every
website; snapping pics on your phone of parking garage
signage and empty containers of food that you need to
restock.

It seems that even when we want certain things to stick,
they just slip away. Sometimes they stay in our brains for a
little while, then disappear when we go a stretch without
using them. Like most people, I managed to do well in
school only when I studied extra hard, poring over French

vocabulary words for hours, doing physics proofs over and
over. But as soon as I put that knowledge to use on a test,
I’d forget it as quickly as I’d crammed it into my brain.
Memorization was tedious and boring, with no precise
principles to speak of and certainly no reward in itself—only
the hope that the material would adhere to my brain for the
rest of the semester.

But then there are some things you never forget, like one
startling, gut-wrenching moment that changed everything. I
was in France, visiting my grandparents. My grandmother
had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s a few years earlier.
The last time I’d seen her, she’d had trouble remembering
where she’d left her cane, or whether she’d set her tarts in
the fridge or on the counter. This time, as she sat across
from me at the table, she turned to my grandfather and
asked him how I was doing, and whether I was planning to
visit anytime soon—completely unaware that I was right
there with her. I was stunned by the depth of her lapse. It’s
hard to forget being forgotten by someone you love.
I started thinking about what was going on inside her
mind, and inside mine. When I returned to Chicago, where I
had recently moved, I couldn’t find a job right away, so I
looked for something else to occupy my time. A few months
before the move I had taken up mountain climbing as a
hobby, but if you’re at all familiar with Chicago you know it’s
not exactly surrounded by rugged highlands. So instead of
climbing, I started looking for ascents of the mental kind—
little ways in which I could improve myself, not just by
adding to my skill set but by actually boosting how my mind
worked.

The first stop on that quest involved numbers—I had
studied math and computer science, and I thought that
being able to calculate in my head would make me a little
sharper in my field. While researching the subject, I
discovered the extreme end of it: the Mental Calculation

World Cup,† where the best head-mathletes flex their brains,
often by incorporating memorization techniques in their
calculations. I wasn’t particularly interested in the esoteric
competition aspect, but I thought it was pretty cool that
these crazy mental feats essentially boiled down to being
able to remember a bunch of numbers in a row. As much as
numbers fascinated me, the life-encompassing possibilities
of memory—what it would mean to improve mine, as well as
what it would mean to lose it as my grandmother had—
fascinated me so much more. So I did what you, perhaps for
reasons not unlike mine, have done: I picked up a self-help
book promising “unlimited mental capacity” and “laser-
sharp concentration.”

### HOW I ENDED UP WITH A CHAMPIONSHIP-

### CALIBER MEMORY

When I first picked up that self-help book, I didn’t know that
competitive memory events existed. Nor did I know that the
top competitors all used essentially the same 2,500-year-old
techniques. And contrary to my assumptions (and the
assumptions of most people I meet who learn that I’m a
champ), the best competitors are not photographic-memory
savants but, rather, average-brained men and women who
trained very hard and mastered these techniques. I had
always believed that memory was inelastic; mine wasn’t
great, and I didn’t expect it to get much better. But I put
aside my skepticism—I was feeling ambitious and was
willing to experiment to test my limits—and soon discovered
that the memory techniques really worked.
Their premise was fairly simple: Our brains are better
equipped to remember certain types of information than
others—anything involving the senses, especially sight and
sense of direction, ‡ is stickier than abstract stuff like
numbers and concepts—so to remember those harder

things we simply have to use a little imagination to
“translate” them into easier things. That means turning
words and numbers into pictures in your mind’s eye, and
imagining list items set against the backdrop of real-life
“anchor points” (such as distinct rooms or intersections)
along familiar paths, called Journeys.

In the first few chapters of this book you’ll learn
everything you’ll need to know about these basics, but for

#### now all you need to know is this: The best way to

#### remember just about anything is to turn it into a

#### mental image. When I first learned all this, I was so

fascinated that I almost didn’t care about how to apply the
techniques in my everyday life. For the most part, the books
I read offered clever little tricks to impress people at cocktail
parties and exercises for those who wanted to become
memory athletes. The practical uses took a backseat. I
mainly had to figure those out for myself, such as when I
interviewed for a waiter job and demonstrated my
competency by learning the whole menu by heart. When I
got the job, I used my newfound memory skills to keep track
of orders without writing them down and to remember the
names of all my regular customers (which did wonders for
my tipping income). I enjoyed unlocking my memory so
much that I started practicing the pure (mostly impractical
but still fun) memory activities that competitors are tested
on, such as memorizing decks of cards and very long
numbers. I was hooked, but as much as I had improved in
just a short time, I felt that I could do better.
In early 2009, I decided to enter my first USA Memory
Championship (USAMC), only a few months after I’d first
learned it existed. If you have no idea what the USA Memory
Championship is, don’t worry, most people don’t. In short,
it’s a day-long competitive memorizing event that tests you
on how fast, how much, and how accurately you can
memorize things—playing cards, numbers, names, words,

and poems, just to name a few. I competed for the first time
two years before it entered the wider public consciousness
after its portrayal in Joshua Foer’s bestselling book

#### Moonwalking with Einstein. Foer had written about the 2005

#### championship for Slate, and in the process discovered that

mastering the sport required no innate gift for memory. In
2006, he returned—as a competitor. And won the whole
thing.

I didn’t know Foer’s story at the time, and had yet to read
his book, but I did know that anyone could win the
championship with enough practice. Unfortunately, two
weeks of rigorous training weren’t enough (I came in
sixteenth overall), but the experience fueled my drive to get
better and better. It took another important experience to
push me to train like a champion, and then become one.
It’s easy to remember the strains and exhilaration of
climbing and summiting a mountain. You don’t usually
remember descending it, unless something dramatic
happens. But when I got down from Denali (aka Mount
McKinley, the tallest peak in North America), I logged onto
social media for the first time in three weeks, only to find
out a devastating fact: My grandmother had passed away.
The shock and grief cut right through my joy. Yet in the
midst of that troubling moment, I searched for, and found, a
purpose to my own life. Could I beat back this disease that
had taken my grandmother’s mind and then the rest of her?
Could I make my mind not only sharper but healthier? Could
I master my memory and help others do the same?

So I trained. For hours a day, I practiced for each event in
the USAMC. I hit plateaus and had to find ways to break
through. I’ll spare you the full breakdown of my training
regimen, but in brief, I knew that if I wanted to beat the
world’s best, I’d have to outwork them. That year (2010), I
came in third. The next year, I trained even harder, and I
became the USA Memory Champion. In 2012, I won again.

Sadly, a small mistake in the finals§ put me in second place
in 2013, but more than anything it motivated me further. In
2014, I reclaimed the crown, followed by yet another win in

2015. Along the way, I also broke a number of U.S. memory
      records¶ and achieved the distinguished Grandmaster of
      Memory title, and I am ranked among the top fifty memory
      athletes in the world. But as proud as I am of those
      accomplishments, and as hard as I worked for them, the
      best part of success is the opportunity it affords me to talk
      about memory to new people all the time, and to show them
      how easy, fun, and life-changing it is to learn these
      techniques and put them to use.

### A DAY IN THE LIFE (WITH AN ENHANCED

### MEMORY)

To be sure, I can’t teach you how to have a perfect memory
—even I don’t have one. I can’t look at a photo for a
moment and later tell you every detail about it. I can’t pick
up a book, flip to any page, and instantly commit it to

memory word for word. But what I can do (and what I’m
sure you can too ) is close my eyes and picture people I
know, places I’ve been, different types of animals, different
types of cars—everything that is meaningful to me. Those
are the things I use (and soon you will as well) to enhance
my memory. The difference between remembering and
forgetting isn’t always about whether or not you can pluck a
thought at random from the back of your mind; more often
than not, it’s about whether you put it in your mind in a
memorable way in the first place.

So, what’s it like being able to remember things that you
typically forget? You’ll find out pretty soon, when you start
putting this book to use. And you’ll find it has a way of
turning a normal day into a pretty wild one—in a good way.
I usually wake up around Garth Algar (Dana Carvey’s

#### character from Wayne’s World), otherwise known as 7:

A.M. I head down to my gym and check out the day’s
workout. First up: Tony Blair is hanging from a ceiling lamp
and giving it a powerful cleaning. Then along comes 50
Cent, floating and doing squats in midair. Finally, James
Bond, with comically enormous pecs and biceps under his
tuxedo, leaps up toward the former prime minister and the
rapper. So that’s 10 (as in 10 Downing Street, the prime
minister’s address) hang power cleans, 50 air squats, and 7
(or 007) muscle-ups.\*\*

After my workout, I head home and hit the shower. That’s
where, like most people, I start going over my to-do list for
the day. If it’s not a long list, I’ll store it in a Journey I’ve set
aside for today: † † my old apartment in Cambridge,
Massachusetts.
By the front door, I email an embarrassing, inappropriate
picture of my business partner, Brian, to all my contacts.
Whoops! (Don’t worry, Brian—that’s not meant to scare you;
it’s just meant to scare me into remembering to email you.)
In the kitchen, I look at my website on my laptop when
along comes a construction crew that smashes a wrecking
ball into the screen. Startling, for sure—enough so to remind
me to work on my website later—but I’ve gotta keep
moving. I head into the living room, where there’s a giant
floating brain with a full set of facial features, glaring at a
deck of cards as it tries to memorize them. I don’t know
whose brain it is, but it doesn’t really matter; it’ll be my
(admittedly much smaller) brain later doing the card
memorizing. Finally, in my bedroom, I train with Oscar De La
Hoya, who wears a no. 4 jersey, trading jabs and uppercuts.

Once I’m clean and dressed, I’ll bring those images to
action: I’ll sit down and send Brian an email, spend some
time working on my website, do my memory training, and
then head out to train with a client at 4:00 P.M.

While I’m walking to my appointment, I run into a guy I
recognize on the street. The scar on his cheek reminds me
of the time I met him at a party and imagined a dog mauling
his face. I felt a little guilty about setting the dog on him,
but how else would I remember his name?‡‡ I greet him as if
I’ve known him for years: “Hey, Diogo!” We make plans to
grab dinner, and he asks me to call him after I’m done with
my client. He gives me his number, 305–399–3026, but I’m
in a hurry so I don’t bother putting it in my phone. I just
close my eyes and picture Ulysses Grant (the person I’ve
very intentionally associated with the number 305 to help
me remember it), along with the Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtle Michelangelo (399), trying out wigs (30) on a snake
(26).
When I go to meet Diogo for dinner, he’s brought along
his friend who was with him at that party. His friend is a
stunningly tall woman with blond hair and big baby-blue
eyes that catch my attention. I remember seeing them

#### transform into two bright blue planets of the Star Wars

universe to remind me that her name is Princess Leia...
well, rather, just Leah.§§ “Leah, great to meet you!”

Just your typical day, right?
Of course, I spend the majority of my time as a memory
competitor, an ambassador for the sport, a teacher of my
methods, and a speaker on the transformative power of
memory training. Even when I’m off duty, I often get roped
into little demonstrations of one sort or another. My friends
rarely let me get through a night where I’m not asked to
show off the power of my trained memory. Memory training
has changed my life in so many ways—not least of which is
overcoming my frustrations and fears of forgetting. And it

has turned out to be so much more fun than I ever
expected.

You already know how frustrating it is to forget things,
and what a relief it is when you rack your brain and finally
come up with what you’re looking for. That’s why you picked
up this book in the first place. But I want you to aim a little
higher than relief. Memory should be joyful—not just
because you can recall what you need to when you need to,
but because the act of storing it is an adventure in itself.

#### And that’s why this book exists: not only to help you

#### improve your memory in everyday situations but to

#### completely change your assumptions and

#### expectations about how memory works.

### HOW THIS BOOK WORKS

Never again will you be a victim of your failing memory!
This book will help you remember those everyday things
that you always hate yourself for forgetting. I originally
decided to write this book for that very reason—to reach
everyday people needing their memory for everyday things.
Of course, there are a number of memory books already
written, so what makes my approach different? Other
memory books explain the techniques well enough, sure,
but none of them manage to relate the techniques to the
common day-to-day events that we all experience
regardless of our age, career, or social status. We all know
life can throw us curveballs from one moment to the next,
so this book and my methods are here for you as a
metaphoric catcher’s mitt—greased and oiled up so you
catch whatever ball is thrown at you without a hitch!

This book may also help you win a memory competition
someday, if that’s something you want. But these are not
the reasons why I wrote it. I want to teach you how to make
the most of your memory by making the most of your

memories—which is to say, how to take the things that have
already been burned into your consciousness, whether real
or fictional, and use the most powerful images you can think
of to remember any new information that comes your way.
These are game-winning techniques, but more importantly,
they’re life-winning techniques, straight from the mind of a
regular, relatable dude (me).

Now, when I say “powerful,” I’m not talking just about
images that can help you turn abstract things like numbers
into more concrete visuals—I’m talking about wild,
outlandish scenes that might make you chuckle or make
your skin crawl but, most importantly, are so absurd that
they’re totally unforgettable. This book is no dry self-help
tome. It is loud, offbeat, colorful, and, oh yeah...

#### MEMORABLE!

Whether you’re learning one technique at a time to help
you in the smallest nuggets of your life, or attempting to
train your memory to become a certified steel trap, this
book contains it all. When you think of a situation where
you’d like to remember better, look it up in the contents,
turn to the corresponding page, and teach yourself how to
never forget in that instance again. There is no defined
linear path to follow in this book (save for the mandatory
“basics” chapter at the beginning) and that is the beauty of
it. No boring recommendations for how many minutes you
need to train every day or difficult tasks to practice. You are
in charge of your own learning pace.

The goal of this book is not only to make you never
forget stuff again but also to make sure you never forget
stuff that is useful for your life ever again. For all those
times you thought to yourself, “Damn, I forgot.. .” this book
will most likely have a chapter on how to deal with it. Jump
from chapter to chapter or read the whole thing through.
Whichever way you read it, you’ll be sure to walk away with

a bag of tips and tricks that’ll help you start taking control of
your own memory.

```
Onward!

- It’s much easier to keep track of the number of people with perfect memories:
  zero, and holding steady.
  † A competition consisting of events like adding ten 10-digit numbers and
  finding the square roots of six-digit numbers—y’know, basic math stuff.
  ‡ Not crazy mental compass stuff, just things like knowing a path from one
  familiar place to another (e.g., from one end of your house to the other).
  § Note to readers and self: If anyone ever asks you to memorize a deck of cards,
  no matter how high or low the stakes, always ask them whether they want
  you to memorize it from front to back or back to front.
  ¶ I held the following records for awhile: fastest time for a deck of cards (40.65
  sec), most digits in 5 minutes (339 digits), most words in 15 minutes (256
  words), most digits in 30 minutes (907 digits), and most decks of cards in 30
  minutes (9 decks and 2 cards). I still hold the U.S. record for the most names
  in 15 minutes (217 names).
  \*\* For those not familiar with CrossFit movements, a hang power clean is a
  common weightlifting maneuver where you lift a barbell from a “hang”
  position (with the barbell hanging just above the knees) to a racked position
  across the deltoids. An air squat is the body weight exercise movement of
  dropping into a squat and standing back up again. Finally, a muscle-up is an
  exaggerated pull-up that vaults your upper body above the bar, with arms
  fully locked out at the top.
  †† A common misconception about Journeys is that you need only one place, and
  that you can just cram everything you ever need to remember into it. In
  truth, you need at least a few, if you’re using them with any regularity and
  don’t want to get them mixed up. If you’re trying to learn something for life
  (say, you’re a history buff and want to remember every U.S. president in
  order), you need a designated place just for that list.

# Basic Things You Must

# Remember Before You Start

#### It’s quite odd, how one occasionally has to hunt around in

#### one’s memory as if for a book in a library without call

#### numbers...

##### —DOUGLAS HOFSTADTER\*

Quick. Think back to your grade school days and try to
remember the first thing that comes to mind: something
that you learned from your favorite teacher; something
trivia-worthy you could impress your friends with. Maybe it’s
the song “50 States That Rhyme,” where you recite all fifty
U.S. states in alphabetical order:

#### Alabama, and Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas,

#### California, Colorado, Co-nnecticut and more,

#### Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho,

#### Illinois, Indi-a-na, I-o-wa... 35 to go...

Or maybe it’s the ruling monarchs of English history sung
to the tune of “Good King Wenceslas”:

#### Willie, Willie, Harry, Stee

#### Harry, Dick, John, Harry three.

#### One, two, three Neds, Richard two

#### Harrys four, five, six... then who...

Or maybe it’s as simple as stating all nine planets in
order (okay, eight if you were born as of the 2000s). Could
you do that? If you did, you probably didn’t use a song but,
rather, a sentence as your mnemonic crutch. Something like
My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Nine Pizzas.

How about when you learned the five Great Lakes and
your teacher told you to remember the word “HOMES”
instead? H for Huron, O for Ohio, M for Michigan, E for Erie,
and S for Superior. I probably don’t even have to remind you
of that one, do I?
For me, without a doubt, the first thing that comes to
mind is the Greek alphabet song I learned in second grade
from Mrs. Greenberg:

#### Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon, Zeta, Eta,

#### Theta, Iota, Kappa, Lambda, Mu, Nu, Xi...

I can remember it clear as day: Mrs. Greenberg etching
the whole list of foreign Greek letters onto the blackboard as
I sat there at my desk, Trapper Keeper wide open, pencil
case in hand, ready to whip out whatever school utensil was
necessary to get that A++. And then that song! I don’t even
know what tune it was, but I can sing that whole Greek
alphabet song as if I were six years old all over again.
We all have some form of knowledge etched into our
brains from when we were young. Whether it was some
fancy song that helped you remember the quadratic
equation† or some silly acronym that helped you remember
all the irregular verbs in French,‡ we all were introduced to
the most basic of memory techniques at a young age.

```
While it’s clear that those memory tricks worked at the
```

#### time, could you explain how or why your teacher made it

stick after all these years? Was it the act of turning the
information you were learning into a song, into a funny
sentence, or maybe into a short acronym? Was that it? If

you tried that now with new information, would that
information also stick for the next twenty years? The honest

#### answer to that question is probably not. But why not?

Sure, our teachers gave us little mnemonic tricks here
and there, but no real training in how our memories work
and how to apply the underlying principles of those tricks to
every other thing you would learn through your school years
(and professional/social life thereafter). In fact, the sad truth
is none of us were actually ever given any proper instruction
on how to use our memories. I mean, why is it that you can
still remember all fifty states with a catchy song you learned
when you were a kid, yet you can’t remember the name of
that person you met earlier today? Crazy, right?
Over the following chapters, you’ll learn plenty of
strategies for remembering—the ones they should have
taught you as a kid but never did—but the first step is to
start thinking differently about how your memory works and
how to better utilize its best qualities. We’ll need to dispel
some of the horrible anti-memory notions that exist in
common lore, so that you can plow full-steam ahead with

#### the mnemonic confidence that you should already have. If

you believe any of the following three misconceptions,
you’re not only wrong: you’re holding yourself back.

### THREE IDEAS TO FORGET

**1. Some people are born with amazing memories, and
you’re not one of them.**

I hear this one all the time, and it’s probably the biggest
barrier most people face when it comes to improving their
memories. I get it: What I do seems unbelievable, and if
you’ve never tried it before, you might think it won’t come
naturally to you. The fact of the matter is that the only
difference between you and me is that I have a ten-year
head start on you. Now, I’ve done a ton of training in those

ten years, and that’s what it takes to beat a field of
competitors that gets better and better every year. But I
didn’t have any sort of special predisposition when I started,
nor did any of the people I compete against. Joshua Foer
went from curious onlooker to U.S. champion in a year,
roughly the same amount of time it took me. As much as
I’ve improved my memory, I still don’t have anything like
perfect photographic recall (nor does anyone else, no

#### matter what they tell you; see the pro tip below for more on

this myth). It’s also important to note that once upon a time
I was not very good at memorizing anything at all. Always

#### remember that whenever you feel overwhelmed or if you’re

frustrated that you aren’t improving the way you want to—I
used to suck too!

As I’ve said, the difference between remembering and
forgetting a piece of information is not about a failure to pull
it out of your brain but about a failure to put it into your
brain in a memorable way. You have to forget all the little
insults you’ve told yourself about having a crappy memory
and realize you’ve just been doing memory wrong this
whole time.

## PRO TIP

**In my opinion, superhuman photographic memory
doesn’t exist, so don’t stress that you don’t have this
skill. On some level, we’re all fascinated with the
notion of human superpowers—it’s a fascination that
fuels a multibillion-dollar TV, movie, and comic book
industry, and it’s brought about many claims of**

#### natural-born talent. In Moonwalking with Einstein,

**Foer gives a remarkable account of his encounters
with two prominent so-called savants. And yet as
amazing as their memory feats may be, even they
can’t capture mental snapshots—at least not in any
way that truly resembles an actual snapshot.**

There is a large body of scientific evidence, however, of
something called “eidetic memory,” present in about 2 to 10
percent of preadolescent children yet virtually nonexistent
among adults. An “eidetiker” can often look at an image for
thirty seconds, look away, and recall astoundingly accurate
details about that image. Nevertheless, eidetikers make
some mistakes and occasionally invent new details. After a
few minutes, eidetic recall ability fades to average human
levels. No one knows why it works like that, or why it
doesn’t last into adulthood, but some theories suggest that
verbalizing—whether you say, “Hey, I’m looking at a pink
saber-toothed tiger!” aloud, or simply to yourself—disrupts
eidetikers’ abilities, and adults are more likely than children
to verbalize in this way.

**2. Some people are visual learners, and you’re not
one of them.**

This is another misconception I hear all the time. Sure, you
might have a preference for hearing things spoken rather
than seeing things written, or maybe you just like to write
things down in your own handwriting to get you more
focused on them. But if written text is your idea of visual
learning, you have some serious unlearning to do.
Visual learning actually has very little to do with what
you see with your eyes, and almost everything to do with
what you see with your mind. Whether you hear a piece of
information, read it, or copy it as you’re reading it, all you’re
doing is giving it your attention. You can pay attention any
way you want—and as we’ll go over a little later, attention is
a BIG part of memory—but attention is only the first step.

```
Creating a visual in your mind is where the real learning
```

#### —or to use a more technical term, encoding—happens.

When you think of your favorite childhood memories, do you
see text scrolling through your mind or do you see faces and
places? Just because we often receive information as

numbers or words doesn’t mean you can’t encode it with
pictures. Whatever you do experience—however you give it
your attention—can be useful in addition to the mental
images you create. Everything you can add in your mind,
whether sounds, smells, tastes, or textures, is icing on the
memory cake.

**3. Your brain can hold only so much information.**

#### There’s a scene in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s A Study in

#### Scarlet in which Dr. Watson is astounded that Sherlock

Holmes believes the sun revolves around the Earth and not
the other way around. When Watson corrects him, Holmes
says he plans to immediately forget the fact. Why? Because
he has no space in his brain for anything unrelated to his
work, since it’s packed to the gills with detective-y bits. And
“there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge,
you forget something that you knew before.” It’s a funny
little theory, a sort of one-in-one-out policy of the mind.
Thankfully, it couldn’t be further from the truth.
According to Dr. Paul Reber, the director of the Brain,
Behavior, and Cognition program at Northwestern
University, the brain does have a limit, but it’s far beyond
anyone’s reach: somewhere in the vicinity of a million
gigabytes.^1 If you had a DVR with that kind of capacity, you

#### could store three million hours of TV shows, or a little more

than 342 years of nonstop action. You could memorize this
book word for word, along with every other how-to on the
planet, and still have room left over for the mechanics of the
solar system.

So you can go ahead and forget what Holmes told
Watson about the brain’s inner workings (though it wouldn’t
tax your brain much to remember it either). Just remember
that it’s wrong.
Now that we’ve gotten those myths out of the way and
we’ve washed your brain clean of those impurities, let’s

insert three simple words that will help you remember
EVERYTHING and ANYTHING...

### THREE WORDS TO REMEMBER

##### SEE—LINK—GO!

Along my journey of learning memory techniques and
eventually getting the opportunities to share my learned
knowledge with audiences, classrooms, and the like around
the world, I realized I needed a short, easy, reliable, and

#### memorable set of instructions that I could teach anyone.

#### Steps that anyone could follow in any situation that merited

memorization.

It’s easy to get caught knee-deep in all the details and
nuances of memory techniques (we’ll get to those details
later), but my near-fail-proof, three-step process boils down
every mnemonic circumstance to something fundamental
and simple. You can literally apply these three words to
anything you want to memorize.§

### SEE

First things first: You can’t **SEE** something if you’re not
paying attention. Half the battle of remembering something
is honestly as simple as paying attention. Whenever I’m
asked to give a quick tip on how to remember better I will,
without fail, say “Pay better attention.” It seems obvious,
but in this day and age attention is in limited supply,
considering all the distractions we have constantly
bombarding us.

```
As you’ll see, the name of the game in improving
```

#### memory is remembering to pay attention. But of course,

#### that requires more remembering! GAHHH! But fret not, the

more you learn about memory techniques and the better
you get at them, the more aware you will naturally become

of your own memory, and in turn, the more you’ll remember
to remember. I promise!

Now, once you’re in the mindset of paying attention and
you’re ready to **SEE** , you need to do something that is quite
frankly, in my opinion, the most important part of

#### remembering: You need to visualize what you are trying to

memorize. To show you what I mean, let’s take a few
minutes and put our minds together—yes, yours and mine,
in collaboration—to paint a picture. Here’s how we do it: On
my end of things, I’m going to use words to describe a little
scenario; your job is to turn this script into a fully realized
movie inside your mind, reading carefully to grasp and
picture every detail (in other words, visualize).
Ready? Here we go.

#### Imagine you’re standing in a flat, grassy field, watching

#### the gentle breeze sway the ankle-high blades. It’s a sunny

#### day, not a cloud in the sky. The grass is green as green can

#### be and the sky is the deepest blue you’ve ever seen. It’s

#### hot, slightly muggy, and the smell of summer grass is

#### wafting up your nose.

#### Off in the distance, you see a tractor approaching you.

#### You can hear it motoring along, with wisps of smoke drifting

#### out its pipes. As it gets nearer, you see something...

#### unusual. Atop the tractor, at its helm, is a massive gray

#### elephant: trunk flailing, tusks arcing skyward, moving to

#### some faint beat emanating from the tractor’s stereo system,

#### dwarfing this tractor like a grownup on a tricycle.

#### As the tractor approaches, George W. Bush, our former

#### president, comes out of nowhere, moonwalking à la Michael

#### Jackson while smoking a cigarette. Picture his navy suit and

#### his small, beady eyes as he does that presidential

#### chuckle/shrug that we know all too well, while taking a deep

#### drag of that cigarette. As he moonwalks closer and closer to

#### the tractor, he flicks his cigarette butt off into the distance

#### where it lands on the shell of a turtle.

#### This turtle is just minding his own business, sitting on the

#### grass, strumming his acoustic guitar with a mushroom. Yes,

#### that’s right, a mushroom. He’s using a mushroom as a

#### guitar pick, and he barely notices the cigarette that bounced

#### off his shell moments ago, as he continues to strum

#### furiously, as if playing some Mumford & Sons song.

Let’s quickly recap all that. There was an elephant
driving a tractor, then George Dubya moonwalking over
while smoking a cigarette, which he flicks onto a turtle
playing the guitar with a mushroom.

#### Was that weird? Yeah, it was weird. What on earth was all

that? Well, it was actually this 24-digit number:

#### 5 5 4 9 6 5 7 5 0 7 2 8 7 0 4 2 4 9 9 5 3 4 4 6

#### HUH? Huh is right. Don’t worry about the sequence of

numbers or how all those characters and actions came to
represent it. What’s important is that imagining my story
was really easy. It didn’t take much effort; it was almost
natural. Yes, pretty much all of it was unreal, or even
impossible, but it didn’t matter because our brains have the
power of imagination; we’re actually all quite good at that.
That’s how we’re able to imagine the future, create new
things, and reminisce about the past. But while that story
has highly memorable qualities, that series of digits does
not. Just looking at those numbers seems daunting and

#### uncomfortable. It’s not because your brain isn’t cut out for it

—it’s because none of our brains are cut out for it.

Our brains were formed back when things were simple—
when the things we encountered every day were entirely
visual. These were things we had to memorize in order to
survive: recognizing the pattern on a plant to tell if it’s
poisonous or not, for example. There were no numbers, no
names, no addresses, no poems, nothing. But slowly, as
time went on, those things made their way into our societies
and cultures, making our brains freak out and scream,
“Ahhh what are these things?!?! I’m not used to them! Get
them away! Or at least let me write them down so I don’t
have to think about them anymore!”
The important thing to take away here is that the brain
prefers visualizing pictures over abstractions like numbers
and letters. So the first step, when memorizing, is always to
find a way to turn the things our brains find difficult into
things our brains can **SEE** and think are easy.

### LINK

Once you’ve found a way to **SEE** what you are memorizing,
the next step is to **LINK** it to a location in your brain. We all
know about and are very aware of memory storage on
computers, right? I mean, how often are we frantically
deleting photos on our smartphones to make space for new
ones because we’ve run out of memory? Or how often are
we buying the latest-size external hard drives to store our
massive music, photo, and video libraries? The more
information we create, the more terabytes of space we need
to store it (by the time this book is comfortably sitting on all
of your bookshelves, it could possibly be petabytes). Why
does that concept make total sense for computers but not
our brains? As philosophically deep as you do or don’t want
to get, the facts are that our brains process information and
then they store it somewhere within their complex neural
networks. While you may be nodding in agreement and
understanding on a general level, you surely must be
thinking, “But how can I knowingly store information in my
own brain in a specific location?”
Think of it this way: You’re working on a document on
your computer and you want to save it. What do you do?
You click the “save” button, right? And then what happens?
A little box pops up asking you to give your newly created
file a name (most likely ending with a “.doc” or “.txt”), and
then you need to specify the folder or directory that you
want it to be stored in (“Documents,” for example). We’re
instructed to do this because the clever folks who invented
computers want us to have an easy way to find and access
the same file at a later date. (You know it’s a document,
therefore it’s most likely stored in your “Documents” folder,
under the file name that describes it—voilà!) Now, imagine
that that didn’t happen—that when you clicked “save,” the
document was saved somewhere in the computer, but your
computer gave you no instruction on how to give it a file

name and a location nor any notification that it was
successfully saved to the disk. Yikes. The computer world
would be an absolute mess.

I hate to say it, but this is your brain. You’re saving stuff
to it without giving it the proper file name and location—no
wonder you have a hard time finding it! Sure, sometimes it
comes to you, but for all those times it doesn’t, wouldn’t
you prefer to have a computer-like procedure to save and
load things? Well, you can, and that’s what the **LINK** step is

#### all about. Taking your mental image from SEE and saving it

to a known location. Thinking about how to do that exactly
may seem a bit weird, might make your brain tickle a little,
or might even sound downright impossible, but it’s actually
quite easy and, as I mentioned earlier, ancient civilizations
did it for hundreds of years.

There are a few basic techniques for storing images in
our brains, and I will go over them here briefly (and in more
depth throughout the book), but the main notion I want you

to become familiar with is, yup, you guessed it, **LINK**. Think
of an actual chain link and how it’s usually a solid piece of
metal wrapped unbreakably around another. Sometimes
these links come in long chains; sometimes one link is
attached or anchored to some singular point. In either case,
the link is attached to something in a way that is considered
unbreakable. In the physical world, this makes sense, but
what about in the intangible world of your mind—what could
serve as a singular point that you could link new information

#### to and is unbreakable? The answer is: Things you already

#### know!

Think of something you know. The capital of Australia—
do you know that one? Or what about the third letter of the
alphabet. Or the name of the planet you live on. Or maybe
you know Schrödinger’s equation. There are some things
that you may have known once, or that you kind of know
when you happen to correctly remember them (perhaps like
the capital of Australia—it’s Canberra, by the way); there
are things you definitely don’t know (for sure Schrödinger’s
equation, unless you’re a physicist); and then there are
things you know like the back of your hand, without even
thinking (the letters of the alphabet and the name of our
planet). The things you know like the back of your hand can
be used to link/anchor new information. In fact, your brain
does this a lot already. Whenever you’re being taught a new
concept, a good teacher might relate it to something else
that you already know in the form of a metaphor. Or you
might even ask, “So it’s a bit like that other thing, only a bit
different with this and that?” For example, imagine if the
only animal you knew of was a dog and I was trying to
explain to you what a bird was. The easiest way for you to
learn what a bird is is for me to explain it in terms of a dog,
since it’s the only animal you know. I might say, “A bird is
like a dog, only smaller, with wings, and can fly.”

Throughout this book, you will find different strategies to
first of all **SEE** , but then also to **LINK**. There are a few
different ways to use things you already know as a link for
remembering new information. These methods are outlined
briefly here to give you the general gist but will be
reinforced as they come up again at later points in the book.
The basic idea of what **LINK** is will be clear in **GO!** , but it’s
as easy as imagining your picture from **SEE** somehow
interacting with a location. It will all make sense soon, don’t
worry!

**1. Simple Association**

Simple Association is where you use another fact, thought,
idea, or mental image that you know very well and that’s
already inside your head. The idea is that you will
link/anchor/associate your new piece of information to this
other piece of information that is already well planted in
your mind. This technique is great for remembering one-off
things or short little facts (see chapter 3, this page, for some
examples).

**2. The Linking Method**
The Linking Method is a simple way to remember a short list

#### of things in a specific order. The key to Linking is interaction:

taking your mental picture for each item and causing it to
interact with the next (imagine it as a chain of links, one
connected to the next). Every interaction forms a bridge
that links one point to the next, creating a seamless
sequence so that you never have to make a tangential leap.
So instead of trying to remember eight different things on
your grocery list, you have to remember only the first thing,
and each item will follow sequentially (see chapter 4, this
page, for some examples).

**3. The Peg Method**

The Peg Method is another basic technique that makes up
for one of the Linking Method’s biggest weaknesses: the fact

#### that you have to access the sequence from start to finish

without jumping around, otherwise you probably won’t be
able to recall the list. The Peg Method works around this
shortcoming by using “pegs” (basically, other images on a
pre-learned list) to “anchor” each item you want to
memorize, rather than linking everything together into a
chain of images. It sounds a little zany, but it’s super simple
and wildly effective for attaining a true mastery of any list—
you’ll be able to jump around that list like a champ,
backward and forward (see chapter 4, this page, for some
examples).

**4. The Journey Method**

What do Hannibal Lecter, Sherlock Holmes, the great Roman
orator Cicero, and nearly every competitive memory
champion (including yours truly) have in common? I wish I
could say it’s our crime-solving genius or our way with
words (and I probably wouldn’t be too far off if I said we all
like a nice Chianti every now and then). But no, the thread
that binds us is that we’ve all mastered “the art of
memory,” a technique that was first described around 93

#### BCE in the Roman rhetorical textbook Rhetorica ad

#### Herennium. Today, it’s known by several names: the Method

of Loci,¶ the architectural mnemonic, the Roman Room
technique, the Memory Palace, and my favorite, the Journey
Method.
The famous story goes, that in the fifth century BCE, the
Greek poet Simonides was the lone survivor of a tragic roof
collapse at a banquet, and was asked whose bodies might
have been buried under the rubble. The names weren’t
coming to him, but when he closed his eyes and thought
back on the banquet table, he had an epiphany: He could
remember every guest as he went seat by seat around the

table. It wasn’t their faces he recalled; it was their places.
That was what many coin as the birth of one of the most
commonly used (and most powerful) memory techniques of
the time, the Journey Method (more on this later). Sadly,
more than two and a half millennia later, only competitive
memory athletes and selected memory enthusiasts are
using the Journey Method. Although it’s no longer used
commonly to memorize, say, the collected works of Homer
(or the filmography of Homer Simpson), it’s still the best tool
out there for mental storage—it’s just been lost somehow
over the centuries.

Like the Peg Method, the Journey Method works by
associating the information you’re trying to remember with
a list of things you already know—but this time the list is a
series of stops along a path, or journey, through an actual

#### place, a familiar place. Think of your home, or your office, or

your favorite park—these are all places you have imprinted
in your mind. You could close your eyes and mentally
navigate through them with ease. It’s those mental spaces,
those journeys, that are made up of locations along a path
(the front door, then the entryway, then the staircase, then
the kitchen, etc.), that will provide a living place for the
information you’re trying to memorize. Sounds a bit
complicated but it’s honestly super easy once you try it, and
we’ll be trying a lot of it throughout this book.
The big advantage of the Journey Method is that your
brain is hardwired for it. Have you ever heard a song come
on the radio that instantly reminds you of where you were
the first time (or the last time) you heard it? Have you ever
looked at an old photo and remembered not only where it
was taken but also what other streets and landmarks were
nearby? Most of us take that sort of spatial awareness for
granted. But it turns out we actually have specialized cells
in the hippocampus—the part of our brains primarily
responsible for converting short-term memory into long-

term—that help us navigate spaces and remember those
places permanently. Recently, neuroscientists at the
University of Pennsylvania have found evidence of
“geotags” in the hippocampus that allow us to remember
where and when specific memories were initially formed.
The geotags activate right before we remember those
memories, signifying that they’re not merely extra details
but, rather, the keys that unlock our minds. With the Journey
Method, we can intentionally slap those geotags on
anything and everything we want to remember (see chapter
4, this page, for some examples).

### GO!

Okay, at this point you’ve taken what you wanted to
memorize and found a way to **SEE** it and **LINK** it—now you
need to take what you have and really **GO!** with it. Let me
explain what that means.
If you need to commit something to memory very
quickly, coming up with pictures ( **SEE** ing) and placing it in a

#### location ( LINK ing) will do the trick, but if you really want to

make something unforgettable you need to **GO!** with it.
Think of **GO!** as the final step where you mesh and glue
everything together and add that extra magic ingredient
that, like industrial super glue, makes a memorized piece of
information stick.

Here’s how you do it: Take what you have from **SEE** and
take what you have from **LINK** and intertwine them as one.
In other words, take the visual image you have in your head
for what you are memorizing and “stick” it on or imagine it
on, or in, or interacting with your chosen location/anchor
point. You have a picture in your mind, now all you’re doing
is giving that picture some scenic detail—a backdrop to live
in. That takes care of the meshing and gluing part. As for
the extra magic ingredient, that involves taking your

imagined scene (your meshed picture and location) and
incorporating three things I like to call **Sensory Overload
(SO), Grotesque Absurdity (GA), and Moveable
Attributes (MA)**.

**SO** is a way to make even more mental connections with
your mental images by using your four other senses too.
When I talk about visualization, I don’t just mean visual as in
eyesight (we aren’t really “seeing” things with our eyes
anyway—it’s all in our heads). I mean really creating an
interactive, all-five-senses scene in your mind’s eye. Shock
value comes into play here too, especially when you just
want to store some basic information and the truth doesn’t
matter.
For example, imagine a pizza. Go for it, whatever pops
into your mind when you read that word. Pizza. Now hold
onto that image for a moment. Of course, you know what
pizza looks like—that’s easy to visualize. But you also can
imagine what it smells like, tastes like, feels like, even
sounds like. To make something super sticky in your head,
you’re going to have to turn all the dials up to 11 and
imagine the most outlandish pizza-related scene possible,
using all of your senses (not just sight). That means the
cheese isn’t just bubbling and sizzling, it’s making crazy
gurgling noises (there’s your sound). The grease is dripping
off of it and scalding your hands (there’s the touch/feel).
Better yet, your hands are on fire because it’s so hot. Maybe
it doesn’t smell and taste like pizza—maybe it’s more like
raw sewage (smell/taste). After all that, you might not be so
hungry for pizza anymore. But if it gets your emotions
running, whether fear or anger or joy or sadness or pain,
you’ll be adding yet another facet to the memory that will
make it stick. The important thing, though, is to make it
vivid. The more you build out your mental picture into
something with all the sensory information you might get in
real life, the more your memory will start to cook!

I sort of touched on this in the few previous sensory
examples, but **GA** is all about making those sensory
additions as weird and over-the-top as possible. To take your
image up even one more notch on the memorable scale,
you’ll want to add some type of absurdity that evokes a
type of emotional response: bizarreness, hilarity, gore,
grotesqueness, eroticism, silliness, etc. Don’t just make that
pizza a boring pizza that smells good and that dripped some
steamy grease onto your hand—turn that pizza sauce into
blood from a dead rat. Or maybe you’re eating that pizza
and the rat is sobbing (I’ve just given him/her human
qualities) as you eat him/her alive! Or maybe the pizza has
a thong on and he/she’s doing a striptease for you. Anything
graphic, funny, bizarre, and sometimes uncomfortably
sexual (also sometimes not uncomfortable at all!) added
with all your sensory information will make an image
explode with brain-adhering sauce.

One more small addition to these images and you’ll be
set; your images will seriously never be forgotten again.
That addition is a **Moveable Attribute** or **MA**. **MA** falls
under the broader umbrella of visualization and it is the final

#### tweak that makes a mental picture completely and

#### absolutely vivid. All it is is giving your already wild and crazy

image some type of movement, some type of action.
Chances are you already did this naturally as you
inserted **SO** and **GA** , but in case you didn’t, make your
visual scene MOVE! I don’t have the neuroscience PhD to
explain why this is so important, but I’ve found in all of my
mnemonic experience that giving movement to an image
will figuratively set your memory on fire (in a good way).
Going back to the previous **GA** examples, you’ll want to
make that stripteasing pizza dance, bend over, twirl, and
flash you all of his/her naughty parts. And that dead rat on
your pizza is actually still twitching a bit because it’s not
quite dead yet. Gross, I know, but now the image has a
moveable attribute and it will, as a result, be more
memorable.

**GO!** breaks down into **SO** — **GA** — **MA** (which kind of
sounds like what you’d say when you’re about to ask your
grandma if she’s going to bake you your favorite cake: “SO,
GrAnd MA.. .”). Adding those three little ingredients to your
mental scene is like adding saltpeter to your gunpowder mix
—they will make your memory gun, so to speak, go BANG!
What this all boils down to is that you want to use

#### everything you’ve got.

### EXTRA TIPS YOU WON’T FIND IN OTHER

### MEMORY BOOKS

You now know the basics of memorization, and you’re nearly
ready to jump into the beef of this book. But before you do
that, there are a few more pieces of wisdom I need to impart

to you before you venture out there into the world of
memorizing.

**1. Trust your memory.**

It sounds simple enough, but it’s the key to improving and
getting better at memorization. There are several reasons
why trusting your memory matters, and most of them are
practical. Surely you want to be able to store and retrieve
things quickly, and at times you want to handle larger
quantities of information without worrying too much about
any one item. But the most important reason to trust your
memory is because we all know the frustration of a memory
lapse, and when it happens it has the power to shame us
into thinking we can’t remember because our minds are
crappy. And that’s just not true. A memory lapse doesn’t
mean your mind has failed you; it means you’ve failed your
mind. When you give it the right balance of **SEE** , **LINK** , and
**GO!** —vivid pictures, a set of anchor points, and plenty of
sensory details—you can rest assured that it won’t crap out
on you. Your memory was designed to work this way. Trust in
the process and the skills that are already waiting to be
activated within your own mind.

**2. When you forget something, don’t blame your
memory!**
Often when people forget something, they will usually say to
themselves (or even out loud), “I have a horrible memory!”
as if it’s something they’ve just accepted their whole life as
a personal shortcoming. This frustrates me to no end

#### because no one has a bad memory—NO ONE. First of all

(and this goes back to trusting your memory), you have to
stop thinking like that. It’s self-defeating and serves no
purpose other than making you and others believe that your
memory is inadequate. The more you give your memory a

#### bad rap, the more it will actually mirror that fact (life tip

#### #1: This applies to anything you do—if you feed the

#### “negative beast,” it will reign).

Henceforth, I want you to be constantly saying to
yourself, “Okay, Nelson didn’t have a good memory and now
he does. I can do the same!” Just remind yourself of that
every time you get frustrated. Repeat the mantra, “I have
an unforgettable memory!” Secondly, remember this: There
are only two reasons why you will ever forget things. Only
two.

#### \* YOU WEREN’T PAYING ATTENTION.

#### \* YOUR SEE—LINK—GO! PROCESS WAS A BIT

#### LEAKY AND/OR WEAK.

That’s it. Simple, right? Notice how neither of those
reasons has to do with you having a bad memory? The first
one is obvious, and we already discussed this a lot—you
can’t memorize anything if you aren’t paying attention to it.
DUH! The second one is more interesting. I’m basically
saying that if you tried to memorize something using the
**SEE—LINK—GO!** process and it still didn’t stick, well, it
means you didn’t do enough of it. You need to go back and
first make sure you really visualized your information, that
you linked it somewhere precise, and most importantly, that
you made it **GO!** (that last step is often the most common
reason a memory fails). If you didn’t, that means you need
to go back and add more color, more intensity, more
raunchiness, more strangeness to make it pop and stick
better. There are no bad memories here! Only bad images!

#### Make them FASTER! SMELLIER! WITH MORE

#### TENTACLES!

**3. Have fun!**
I can’t stress this enough. Memorizing has often gotten a
bad rap as being a task that is boring, tedious, and
completely eye-gouging. The only reason it has that
reputation is because, as kids, we were never shown the
correct and easy way to memorize. We always had to
memorize by rote repetition, or what I like to call the brute
force method. Ufff, no wonder memorizing always felt like
the worst thing in the world—BECAUSE IT WAS! But with the
techniques I’ve shown you in this chapter, and the
techniques I’m going to show you throughout this book...
NEVER AGAIN! Memorizing is fun, silly, empowering, and the
greatest skill/tool you’ll ever learn. Have fun with it! And
even if you sometimes fail at making something stick, no
worries. Get back up and try again. Remember that it’s a
skill, and, as with any skill, to really get good at it you need
to practice often. I didn’t become a memory champion
overnight; it took me two full years. That being said, you’ll
be able to accomplish a surprising number of impressive
things off the bat with almost zero practice. You ready?

Without further ado, I now release you into the wild world
of mnemonics. Remember to **SEE—LINK—GO!** and all will
be groovy. You will be a memorizing machine in no time!

# Brain Farts, Name-Amnesia, and

# the Everyday Things That Drive

# Our Memories Mad

#### The true art of memory is the art of attention.

##### —SAMUEL JOHNSON\*

Alright, you’re ready to dive in! Let’s go!

The best place to start is with the everyday kinds of
things that don’t require too much technique and setup to
memorize—like where you parked your car, why you walked
into a room, and someone’s name. These are things you can
start working on right away and that will help you
tremendously.
Remember our easy-to-remember memorization process
**SEE–LINK–GO!** First, find a way to **SEE** the thing you’re
trying to memorize in your mind as a picture. Then **LINK** it,
or anchor it, to something you already know well. In this
chapter, we will be looking at the Simple Association
approaches. And finally, **GO!** Make that image really
memorable, using all of your senses, your emotions, and
some movement. Follow that simple three-step process and
your memory will be unstoppable.

Some of the things we’ll cover in this chapter may not
seem like big-ticket items when it comes to improving
memory, but you need to start somewhere, and I promise
you that if you can stay on point memorizing these smaller

things, it will pave the way for the more complex mnemonic
strategies in later chapters.

## SECTION 1 — PAYING ATTENTION

Let’s face it: Forgetting sucks. What sucks even worse is
when it feels like your brain is failing you. The thing is, it’s
usually not your brain’s fault. As I said before, when you
have a memory lapse, it doesn’t mean your brain is failing

#### you; it means you’ve failed your brain.

I’m not trying to mind-shame you here, just telling it like
it is. Think about it like this: You can’t make dinner if you
haven’t stocked your pantry, and you can’t remember
anything long-term if you never even had it in your short-
term memory.

#### Memory starts and ends with paying attention.

There is no way around it. While your attention span is the
most valuable mental resource at your disposal, you have
only a limited supply of it. The good news is that although
none of the techniques will make distractions go away
entirely, the more you train your mind, the more alert you’ll
become as you take in new information. This is especially
true when you start working on getting faster at
memorization, which means reading things faster, picturing
things faster, and making every split second count.
Distractions will always crop up, but you’ll get better and
better at canceling those things out. The more you learn
about memory techniques and the better you get at them,
the more aware you become of your own memory, and in
turn, the more you’ll remember... to remember.

### WHAT WAS I ABOUT TO DO?!

##### WHEN YOU WALK INTO A ROOM AND FORGET WHY

It’s fairly common to walk into a room suddenly unsure of
what you were about to do. Don’t you hate when that

#### happens?! I do. It’s such a pain, and it drives me nuts. It

also wastes my precious time as I stand there, tapping my
forehead as if that will help the lost memory come to mind.
Applying a technique to remedy this problem isn’t always a

#### surefire solution. But you’ll find it’s a near-surefire solution.

One thing I will continuously harp on throughout this book is

#### that having a good memory isn’t just about tricks and

#### techniques. Rather, it’s a way of life. Let me explain.

The more you learn about how your memory works and
how the techniques I will be teaching you take advantage of
those workings, the better your memory will become. For

#### one, because you’ll be using your memory and

strengthening that mnemonic muscle. But also because you

#### will be thinking through the lens of a mind that wants and

#### chooses to memorize things. This is a very powerful tool in

itself. If memory is constantly on your mind, then meta-
memory will constantly be on your mind as well (basically,

#### thoughts about how you memorize something, not just the

direct memory of something). If this is happening in your
head (and by the time you get through most of this book, I
promise you it will be), then memory lapses, such as
walking into a room and forgetting what you were going to
do, will happen less and less—for the sole reason that your

#### memory will be primed to keep things memorable. This is all

#### a fancy way of saying that you will be paying more attention

to the world.
Now if you’re still itching for a little tip that might help
you in the interim, keep on reading. To understand this tip, it

#### helps to understand why walking into another room makes

us forget things we thought of in a previous room.

Dr. G. A. Radvansky, a professor in the Department of
Psychology at Notre Dame, published the results of his
research on this exact phenomenon in a paper titled,

“Walking through Doorways Causes Forgetting: Further
Explorations.”^1 What he discovered is that our brains tend to
compartmentalize events or thoughts and attach them to a
room or space—typically, the place where the thought was
initially conceptualized. So when a person has a thought in
one room and moves to another, the brain basically creates
a file containing all the details about the first room, what
you did there, and what you thought there, and stores it
away. When you move to the second room, your brain
creates a new file, making it harder to remember what was
in the file for the previous room. This happens
subconsciously, so there isn’t any way that we can be aware
of it and control it. But it is interesting to point out that you
are more likely to remember something when you simply
walk from one side of the room to the other, rather than
walking through a doorway into an entirely new room!

So if this is what happens in our brains, what’s the trick
to remembering in these situations? It’s as simple as going
back to the previous room or place you were in when you
had the thought you’re trying to remember. This will work

#### with limited success, but at least it’s something. The true

hack is what I mentioned before: Get to a point where
memory is a way of life and your memory will naturally
perform better. Or follow the advice of Dr. Radvansky
himself: “Doorways are bad. Avoid them at all costs.”

### UH, WHAT WAS THAT, HONEY?

##### HOW TO REMEMBER THINGS SOMEONE ASKED YOU

##### TO DO

##### (MOST IMPORTANTLY YOUR SPOUSE)

You’d think that, as a memory champion, I’d be impervious
to forgetfulness. Well, I’m not. And unfortunately, the
forgetfulness I experience (it is rare, I should mention!) is
often tied to things my wife says. This isn’t intentional, of

course; I love my wife and value anything she says

#### immensely. It’s just that sometimes I’m not listening. What

else can I say? Nothing new or revolutionary here. I mean,
I’m not the first husband to say he wasn’t listening to his
wife, or vice versa, or the first person to zone out during a
conversation with a friend.

So how do we prevent this from happening? How do you
make sure that you remember the important things the
person you’re having a conversation with says to you? It

#### starts with the obvious, which I mentioned earlier: paying

#### attention.

Paying attention to something takes a concerted effort.
Some of us are more prone to distractions: actual physical
distractions in front of us or random monkey brain–type
distractions that race across our minds. And while it may not
be something we can control 100 percent of the time, there
are tricks you can set your mind up for so that it is more
likely to pay attention.

For one, if someone is talking to you, look him/her in the
eyes. Try to maintain that eye contact during your
conversation. Second, put away any distracting device. Put
your phone in your pocket, close your laptop, put down your
book. Don’t do it half-assed—no lowering of phones but
keeping them in hand, no looking up from a computer but

#### keeping it open, you get the idea. Commit to the

conversation. It’s not that hard.
Nine times out of ten, you’ll find that this will do the trick.
If you’re also in need of remembering the details of a
conversation, whether your significant other is giving you
instructions or you’re on a date trying to learn about
someone you fancy, here’s what you do: As the words make
their way into your ears, visualize them, as if they’re in a
movie that’s playing right before your eyes. I like to think of
it as an old-timey movie where the film strip is just a framed
picture followed by another, zipping by horizontally. Of

#### course, there is no movie actually playing in front of your

#### eyes, you’re just visualizing it in your mind’s eye. You can’t

#### visualize each frame—that’s too fast—but you can envision

the general idea. If, for example, the person you’re speaking
with is telling you about where he/she grew up and this one
time when he/she did this or that, actually imagine it. Let it
wash over your mind as if it was an actual memory of your
own. This method won’t guarantee 100 percent of the
details will stick, but you will have a better comprehension
of the overall gist of what was said.

That’s one instance, but what about instances where you
actually have to remember specific details? Say you were
given an instruction or fact to hold, what then? The previous
technique still applies, except that after you visualize the

#### instruction as an image, you then need to anchor it to

something.

#### Now, anchoring is a term I will use a lot in this book, so

#### let’s define it here: Anchoring is when you associate

#### one new incoming piece of information with another,

#### already grounded piece of information. In other words,

#### it’s a form of linking, where you visualize a new piece of

data and have it link to something that you already have
firmly rooted in your brain (thus the anchor reference).

### LET’S TRY ONE TOGETHER

**EXAMPLE—You’re talking to your boss and he/she
says: “Make sure to take this document to FedEx and
make one hundred copies.”**
Okay, from that statement, the two important facts gleaned

#### are FedEx and one hundred copies. Visualizing yourself

actually walking into FedEx and printing one hundred copies
is a fine and helpful place to start, but let’s say this is a do-
or-die situation; your job is at stake if you screw this up. To
make it stick better, you’ll need to anchor it. Our anchor

needs to be something that is already fixed in our mind,
something that won’t change, and something that is
associated with the thing we are trying to memorize. A great
choice for an anchor in this case would be your boss.

How about imagining taking your boss’s head and
slamming it into the copy machine one hundred times,
resulting in one hundred copies? You wouldn’t mind that, I
bet. Although a bit aggressive, it gets the job done.
Remember, imagery that goes a bit over the top, even if it’s
a bit gruesome, is like mnemonic wildfire. It will make things
stick like glue.
See how we took an image of a copy machine and the
number one hundred, and then attached them (or anchored
them) to your boss? That simple process is called anchoring,
and it will help you remember things like this on the fly.

## SECTION 2 — PLACING THINGS AND

## DOING THINGS

Let’s move on to things that are a little more difficult and
that are (let’s be honest here) a complete menace to our
daily lives. I’m talking about things like forgetting where you
parked your car, where you put your wallet, or if you took
your daily medication or not. Just think, if you could
eradicate these annoyances from your brain’s daily
mishaps, you’d be way less stressed, much happier, and
more productive than you ever imagined!

In the previous section, we talked a lot about paying
attention. Every memory technique I bring up from here on
out will require that same intense focus, but now we will
start to build on that very fundamental necessity for a good
memory. Then we’ll add strategies that will allow us to
memorize more, reliably and quickly—namely, using that
**LINK** step to anchor information in our brains with some
Simple Association.

### ZONE B OR 6TH FLOOR?

##### HOW TO REMEMBER WHERE YOU PARKED YOUR CAR

Close your eyes and picture this all-too-familiar scene:
You’ve just parked your car at the stadium, excited to see
the match. People in jerseys are filing down the rows of cars
toward the entry gates, some are grilling off the back ends
of their trucks, the pregame excitement is palpable. About
halfway down the parking lot, you remind yourself to look
around and find the zone letter and/or number for where
you parked your car. You see it and take a mental note of it,
but you know all too well that you’re going to end up
spending a good twenty minutes trying to find the car once

#### the game is over. Knowing this, you squint extra hard at the

number, hoping that helps cement the information in your
memory.

As predicted, the game ends and you set one foot into
the parking lot and fail to remember that zone number you
tried so hard to memorize. It wouldn’t be so bad if the
parking lot didn’t look like it extended all the way to the
ends of the universe!
I lived in a forty-story condo for a few years and it had
seven levels of parking. If I was home early, I could snag a
third- or fourth-floor spot, but if I arrived later, that meant
an annoying sixth- or seventh-floor spot. The point is, the
floor changed quite often. I can’t tell you how many times I

was in a rush the next morning, thinking I knew where my
car was, only to walk around floor by floor until I found it
where I least expected it to be (and that’s not fun because
that nice crisp and clean shirt I had on would suddenly be
drenched in sweat). Curses!

This was before I studied memory techniques, so once I
learned about them, I came up with my own little trick
specifically for these situations. The first thing to remember

#### is that you are now trained to be in the mindset that your

#### memory matters! With that in mind, you need to be more

present and in the moment. Before you exit your car, you
need to remember to make a mental note of where you
parked your car. This is first and foremost.
Applying our **SEE—LINK—GO!** mantra from chapter 2
(see this page), you first need to create an image for the
floor number (or zone, level, letter, color, whatever). Then
you have to **LINK** it (or anchor it) to something (remember
Simple Association from chapter 2, this page?). In this case,
your car makes the most sense. So imagine the floor image
stuffed or trapped inside your car or interacting with your
car, and voilà, that parking spot location should be
cemented in your memory!

### LET’S TRY A FEW TOGETHER

**EXAMPLE 1—4th Floor**
One of the simplest ways to come up with an image for the
number 4 is using the Number-Shape System (more on that
in chapter 5, this page). In short, we need to come up with

#### an image that the number 4 looks like. So I would ask

myself, “What object does the number look like?” To me, a 4
looks a lot like the unfurled sail of a sailboat.

That’s all it takes!
Now **GO!** Take that sail and stuff it in your car. Make it
crash through the window; imagine all that salt water it

carried in getting all over the upholstery of the car. Take it
even further by imagining that a seagull was caught in the
folded sail and now it’s flapping all over, trapped in your car,

#### wreaking havoc. Feathers and bird droppings everywhere.

Unforgettable, right?

The next day, when you’re about to press that number in
the elevator to get to your car, you’ll have no choice but to
see that crazy sail messing up the inside of your car.

```
4TH FLOOR, PLEASE!
```

**EXAMPLE 2—Zone B**
Letters are easy. Just choose a random, memorable word
that starts with the letter and use that as your image. When

#### I see the letter B, the first word that comes to mind is bread.

Your car has now become a full-fledged baker’s oven!
Imagine your car filled with bread being baked, filling up
your car with a delicious smell, churning out loaf after loaf.
Umm... delicious!

```
Oh, and Zone B was where we parked the car, of course.
```

## PRO TIP

**Some of you may be thinking, “This would be fine if I
parked my car once every so often. What about when
I park my car multiple times a day? Won’t these
images clash against each other and I’ll end up
confused?” Yes, that’s possible. The point is to make
it unique for every instance. You can do that by
elaborating on your image in a more pertinent way
(something that relates to your day or what you’re
currently doing). Let’s say it’s my third time parking
in the 4th floor parking spot from Example 1. Let’s
also say that I’ve already parked on two other floors
earlier that day. I would still imagine that sail, but I’d
tie it to something I just did or am about to do.
Maybe I just got home for the night and that’s the
end of my day—I’m about to go eat dinner. Find a way
to relate that sail in your car to dinner. How about
this: Your dinner is actually wrapped (like a burrito)**

**in that sail when you throw it into your car? It’s as
simple as that!**

**EXAMPLE 3—Red Floor**

Sometimes parking zones are distinguished just by colors.
No worries—think of something that the color reminds you
of (and of course, don’t forget to go with things that are way
over the top). When I think of red, I think of ketchup. It’s

#### smeared all over the inside of your car and is dripping

everywhere. This scenario is most likely a really bad
situation for you if that were the truth, but hey, now you
have nearly unlimited scoops of that delicious condiment for
your lunch!

## PRO TIP

**This is a bit obvious, but it helps reduce the amount
of times you need to memorize your parking spot:
Whenever you can, park your car in the same place
or area. That way you know where your car is
typically and you don’t have to memorize it. You only
need to memorize it when it’s not on that default
floor.**

##### EXAMPLE 4—R 21

Okay, now they’re really trying to make sure you forget your
parking spot! But no worries, simply combine what we have
learned in the previous examples and create one mega-
image. As in Example 2, since there is a letter, I will pick a

#### word beginning with R.

Let’s go with rhinoceros.
Maybe it’s trickier to come up with an image that looks
like 21, a two-digit number (using the Number-Shape
System I mentioned in Example 1), but why not just try to
find it a meaning—one that you create—and relate it to the

Rhino. Maybe the Rhino is 21 years old and has just had his
birthday! Now place that image inside the car as with the
rest. This situation is really no different from the others, just
a little more effort goes into coming up with the linked
image.

Of course, there will be situations where some buffoon
decided that more complex parking location numbers were

#### a great idea, and you’ll be there staring at it like how on

#### earth am I supposed to memorize this?! But no worries, as

we move on to more complex systems for numbers and
codes in later chapters, you’ll be a pro at handling even the
most complicated parking garages.

### WHERE DID I PUT MY KEYS?

##### HOW TO REMEMBER WHERE YOU LEFT ANY ITEM

It always happens when you’re in a massive rush, right
when you’re about to head out the door. “WHERE ARE MY
KEYS?!?!” you silently rage at yourself, frustrated that
you’ve yet again forgotten something so elementary as
where you placed the keys you use every... single... day.
Ugh. Don’t worry. This is normal and it doesn’t mean your
memory is slipping away. You still have hope! The reason
you forget where you place your keys (or your wallet, or
your phone) is because you probably:

**1. Put them down in a rush when your mind was**
**focused on something else, on a more pressing**
**task. 2. Put them down in a place where they typically**
**aren’t placed, thus making them harder to locate**
**in your mind when you’re trying to remember.**

#### The quickest and most obvious solution (and this is so

simple, you’ll laugh at me for even suggesting it) is to make
sure you have a designated place to put an item every time
you put it down.

You have to understand that for something as minute as
putting down a single item, our brains couldn’t care less.
Think about it. What’s more important, tossing your keys
down on the couch or making sure to walk your dog who is

#### whining and begging to be let out immediately?

Yeah... the dog, of course. Or tending to your baby, or
getting your work done and answering your emails, or
cooking dinner, or getting ready for a date, etc. So we

#### should anticipate that our brains are not paying attention to

#### where we leave the item in the first place. And if we can

anticipate it, then we need to hijack our memory, providing
it with a little crutch to help make that placement
unforgettable.

That crutch is a designated placement spot. Buy a small
bowl or tray and place it by the front door. Get in the habit
of always placing your keys there when you come home.
Same with your wallet or backpack or bills. Whatever it may
be: Create a designated placement spot and always put the

#### item there. In addition, make sure that that spot is in your

#### way whenever you enter the location where you plan on

leaving the item. Make it so obvious a place that your brain
has no choice but to see it and place the item there.
Using a designated placement spot is the quickest and
easiest hack and probably takes care of 80 percent of cases.
But what about the rest of the time? Sure, it’s super
common to find yourself in a situation that isn’t so habit-
friendly. For those cases, we can use a technique I like to
call the Move It or Lose It Method.

#### The technique asks that before (or as) you put the item

#### down, you literally make a move. Perform an action as you

place it. By “action,” I mean any random movement that

comes to mind—the stranger, the better (and the more
memorable, of course). By doing something so out of the
norm, you’re basically sending a warning to your brain,
causing it to be hyperalert about that particular moment in
time, making it easier to remember later on. When you are
searching for those lost keys in the future, you’ll remember
the associated bizarre action you performed as you put
them down, which will also trigger an association with where
you performed the action, leading you to remember where

#### you placed the keys. Boom.

**EXAMPLE 1—Tossing the keys on the couch.**

Before I toss those keys on the couch, I might take the keys
that are currently in my hand and lightly tap myself on the

#### head with them and then toss them. That out-of-the-

ordinary movement of tapping yourself on the head (with
the keys themselves, even!) will be a memorable snapshot
in time to help you in the future. When you think back on
where you were when you placed your keys, you’ll
remember that memory of tapping yourself on the head
before throwing them on the couch.

#### AHA, THE COUCH!

##### KEYS. FOUND.

## PRO TIP

**Now, am I asking you to do some silly movement
every single time you move something or put
something down? No, that would be crazy! But do it
for things that are important and that you constantly
find yourself losing. Over time, as you get better at
this whole memorizing thing, you will get better at
being more aware of your memory and how it’s
designed to work. Once you’ve tapped into that,**

**you’ll find that a lot of the tips I’m giving you will
come naturally with very little effort!**

**EXAMPLE 2—Placing your wallet in your purse or bag.**

Again, right as I placed the wallet in my bag, I would take a
brief second to perform some out-of-the-norm action. I’m
just throwing out random ideas here (honestly, the best
actions are going to be the random ones you come up with
in that moment), but maybe I’d tug on my ear and scrunch
my nose.
There you have it. As simple as that.
I know you may be thinking, “Nelson, this is ridiculous.”
And you’re right. It is ridiculous. But that’s just the point.
Ridiculousness helps memory. Why not take advantage of it?
There will be times when you’re in a public place and
maybe it’s a bit uncomfortable to tug your ear and scrunch
your nose. I get it. But there are an infinite amount of
actions you could perform, and many of them are way more
discreet than those that I suggested. So there is no excuse.
Go out there and make some ridiculousness to help your
memory!

```
This technique works best for things that you typically do
```

#### a lot in your everyday life. Things that you might

characterize as the repetitive chores you do on a consistent
basis. You pay your rent monthly, you wash yourself in the
shower every day (gosh, I hope so), you take a pill every
day (maybe not, but you get what I mean). It’s not so much
that you’ll forget to do any of these things; rather, it’s that
you’ll forget whether you’ve already done them or not. This
is because all the memories of you doing those things will
bleed together since they were all so unoriginal. When you
step aside to give them an original quality, you suddenly
cause each to pop out from the rest, thus making each one
memorable.

## PRO TIP

**It’s easy to set a reminder on your mobile device to
help you remember some of these things, I’ll give you
that. But there are situations where it’s just not
feasible to access your phone. On top of that, you’re
not using your brain. Remember what I said earlier—
we want to get you into a place where memory is
constantly on your mind. The more you use your
memory, the better it will naturally be.**

### MUST. NOT. FORGET. TOMORROW... ZZZZZZZZ

##### HOW TO REMEMBER THINGS WHEN YOU DON’T WANT

##### TO GET UP AND WRITE THEM DOWN

A good reminder is all about creating a defense against
letting yourself forget. That means knowing how to get your
own attention when it counts. Say I’m headed to a birthday
party the next time I leave my house, and I need to bring
my friend’s gift with me. I think about Future Nelson and
how absentminded that guy is, and I think about idiot-
proofing for him. I make it impossible for myself to forget—if
I can’t stop my mind from ignoring the gift, I can stop my
body. I put it on the floor, directly in my path to the front
door. Once I put it there, it’s as if I’ve time-shifted the
remembering. Future Nelson doesn’t need to remember,
because Present Nelson already did.
If you prefer to tie a string around your finger or write a
note on your hand, those can be good reminders. But even
better is a method I like to call the Throw the Pen Method.
This method works best when you’re in a compromised
position and need to make sure your future self remembers
something. By compromised position, I mean in a situation
where you can’t tie that string around your finger or write

#### that note on your hand (or, more of a tsk-tsk behavior, jot it

down in your phone), such as when you’re in the shower, in
bed about to go to sleep, on an important call, etc.

It works the best for me when I’m in bed ready to doze
off, when all of a sudden I remember I need to do something
the next day. Rather than get up out of bed, I grab
something (usually a pen, but any throwable, not-too-
breakable object at hand will do) off my bedside table and
toss it on the floor. Then I come up with an image for the
thing I need to remember and **LINK** it to the item. When
morning comes and I run into this item, so blatantly
disrupting the cleanliness of my floor, I’m reminded of the
image of the thing I needed to do! As long as you’re placing
some obvious clue in a place where you will definitely
encounter it at a future time, and as long as you link an
image to that clue object, the method works.

### LET’S TRY A FEW TOGETHER

**EXAMPLE 1—Email Chip first thing when you get out
of the shower.**

Chip is an important guy, and he’s been on your to-do list of
people to get back to, but you forgot to do it yesterday and
now it’s even more pressing. What’s worse is that you’re in
the shower, getting ready for work, when it suddenly hits

#### you. You have to email him back pronto. Obviously, you’re in

the shower, doing your scrubby-scrubby business, so you
can’t write and send off that email at that very moment. But
you want to remember to do it first thing after getting out of
the shower. If you’re at the tail end of your shower, then no
problem, just get out, towel off, and write that email. But
let’s say you just turned on the water. You’re already
soaked. You still have to soap up, wash your hair, and shave.
It’s easy to lose track of thoughts like that in the shower,
with your mind wandering to and fro, so you decide to apply

the Throw the Pen Method and be done with it (until you get
of the shower).

You see an old razor casing resting on the edge of your
bathtub, so you grab it and toss it onto the bathroom floor
outside the shower. Next you quickly come up with an
image for emailing Chip, and anchor it to the razor case. For
the image, you might just consider whatever the email is
supposed to address and somehow relate it to an image for
Chip (potato chip, perhaps?). Let’s say it’s about an
estimate on some printing material he needed to get to you.
In that case you would just imagine the razor case as an
actual printer, printing out dozens upon dozens of potato
chips, cluttering up the entire wet and steamy bathroom
floor.

**EXAMPLE 2—I need to mail my rent check tomorrow.**

Let’s say you’re in bed after a busy day of work, and you’ve
mentally thrown in the towel. Time to relax and doze off. But
suddenly, that monkey brain of yours meanders off and
remembers that the rent is due tomorrow. You don’t want to
get up out of bed and write the check, seal it in an

envelope, and get it ready to mail out, so rather than hoping
you’ll remember in the morning as you rush to get to work
on time, you apply the Throw the Pen Method. You reach to
your bedside table and grab a book you have sitting there.
You toss it on the ground by the side of your bed and then
you focus on coming up with an image for “paying the rent”
that you associate with (or anchor to) the book. You think of
opening that book and inside (maybe even as a bookmark)
you magically find a check worth so much money that you

#### wouldn’t have to pay rent ever again! Just picture that

image. Make sure to add all the peripheral emotions and
color that come with that scenario. How would you feel?
Imagine actually holding the check in your hands. This level
of detail will make that image pop. So when you wake up in
the morning and walk across the book on the floor, you
won’t be able to forget the rent check!

## PRO TIP

**If there’s nothing at your disposal to “throw,” and
you just need to hold on to that memory for a few
more minutes (maybe you’re just being temporarily
distracted, like by a conversation, for example), a
quick thing to do is to cross your fingers, or cross
your feet, or move some body part slightly.
Something that’s maybe a bit uncomfortable or weird
that will draw attention from your mind, even after
the conversation is over. Once you’re free again, that
oddly placed body part will remind you to do what
you had thought about during the conversation.**

## SECTION 3 — NAMES AND FACES

#### Remember that a person’s name is to that person the

#### sweetest and most important sound in any language.

##### —DALE CARNEGIE†

There’s an epidemic sweeping across the globe and laying
waste to every human brain in its path. I know it’s out there,
because everywhere I go, I hear people tell me the exact
same story: “I’m great at remembering faces—I never forget
the face of someone I’ve met—but I’m terrible with names!”
It’s everywhere, it’s debilitating, and it’s about time you
learned how to cure yourself of it.

### NICE TO MEET YOU, I ALREADY FORGOT YOU...

##### HOW TO REMEMBER FIRST NAMES

Here’s the thing: No one is actually terrible with names. The
main reason we think we are is because we feel that we

#### should be able to remember names—and when we can’t

#### remember a name, it hurts. You see a person walking

toward you and you think, “Hey! I know her! I know her
face, I know she’s from St. Louis, and I know that she loves

#### sea turtles and ’80s music, but what the heck is her

#### name?!?! Aaaarrrrggghhhhhhh.” You hide a grimace

beneath a painfully forced smile. If you know a person, it
seems only logical to know the number one piece of
information that identifies him or her in the human world:
his or her name.
Since we can’t remember names very well but feel that
we ought to, we make up excuses—or sigh and say we suck
at it. And if we think we downright suck at something, we
ideally should work to get better at it, not just tell everyone
we’re bad at it...

#### The first thing to do is easy: Try a little harder.

Seriously, just try. If you and your friends go to a party and

make a game out of who can remember the most people’s
names by the end of the night, you’ll be surprised at how
well you’ll do (especially if you’re really competitive or if you
put something of value on the line to make it interesting).

If you really want to win that game, though, all you need
to do is follow the **SEE—LINK—GO!** process, albeit with a
slight twist. In this case, since remembering someone’s
name usually happens in public with reputations possibly on
the line, you’ll need to be able to do this on the fly, and that
means needing to choose a location or **LINK** before you
**SEE**. (I promise this is the only time I’ll switch this up on
you! You’ll understand soon why it’s important.)

### LINK

To store a name, you need only one anchor point, and you
need it to be a cue that will lead you to the name whenever
you see that person. Kinda sounds like a mix of a few of the
**LINK** strategies I outlined in chapter 2, this page, right?
Before deciding on one of them, let me ask you something:
What’s the one thing you’re guaranteed to see every time
you encounter someone? That’s right, his or her face.
Remember how I preached that **LINK** is all about using
things you already know to remember new things? Well, a
new person’s face is the very thing you will know the next
time you see the person. We may be horrible at names, but
we are naturally good at recognizing faces, so let’s use that
to our advantage.

As I said before, speed is of the essence when it comes
to this process. You want to have an attribute picked out by
the time you hear the person’s name, so you can then store
it right away. The attribute you pick as your anchor should
be the first thing you notice about someone, since it will
probably be the first thing you’ll notice the next few times
you see that person. What we’re trying to do here is
minimize the amount of time and effort. Picking an attribute
is easy if you meet someone with a huge, witch-like nose or
a hairy mole. For a generic face, it may be that you just take
some minor characteristic like a slightly cleft chin or a tiny
wrinkle and then blow it out of proportion when you
visualize it. If the first thing that catches your eye is a crazy
hairdo, a Hawaiian shirt, a pair of cat-eye glasses, or
anything else style-related, you can use it as your anchor—
but beware: People don’t always retain the same look.\* If

you can’t spot the anchor, you’ll have a harder time
recalling the name that’s associated with it. Unless an
introduction unfolds so quickly that the only thing you catch
is the person’s style or fashion sense, it’s better to go with
something more permanent (barring any plastic surgery
between your encounters).

Sometimes you’ll be introduced to ten people all at once,
and sometimes half of them will have big noses. You might
be tempted to look for attributes that are unique to each
person, but you won’t have time to think that much. If
everyone in the room has a huge nose, so be it. The unique
part will be the concept you use for each person’s name,
and you’ll picture each person’s face along with it.
Now, I’m about to tell you something important, so
forgive me in advance for shouting it. No matter what you
do, no matter who asks, no matter how proud you feel for
mastering this technique, DO NOT TELL A PERSON HIS OR
HER ANCHOR ATTRIBUTE. From personal experience, I can
assure you that, no matter what, this is a terrible idea. Even
when you think you’re being slick and explaining the
technique to the person with the beautiful eyes, the person
with the unibrow will inevitably jump in and ask, “What
attribute did you use for me?” Just... don’t.

Don’t get frustrated if at first you struggle to choose an
attribute on someone with a generic face. It may be hard to
find some tiny, barely noticeable feature to use, but

#### everyone has something you can grab onto, and with a bit

of practice you’ll get better at it.

### SEE

Attention is key when it comes to catching someone’s name
and giving yourself a chance to encode and store it. In a
typical social setting, as well as many business settings, you
can easily be caught off guard by an introduction.

Sometimes new acquaintances will tell you their name and
then jump straight into conversation. If you’re not ready to
use your working (short-term) memory to keep a name in
mind while you try to create a memorable mental image,
the name will be gone by the time you realize it would be
useful to remember.

Once you’re focused and ready for any meet-and-greet
situation that comes your way, you can get a jump on
visualizing.
Here’s your moment: the big handshake. You’re focused,
you’ve got your attribute all picked out, you’re ready for
that name, and now you simply need to hear it. Whenever
possible, try to ask people for their names (it’ll add to your
focus factor), or, if they come right out and tell you, repeat
the name back to make sure you heard it correctly. The
more often and more clearly you hear the name, the easier
it will be to memorize.

Whatever you do, make sure you’re 100 percent clear on
the name. I don’t know why, but for some reason people
find it more embarrassing to ask for a name a second or
third time than to forget the name completely and be forced
to address somebody with “Hey, guy” or “What’s up, man”
for eternity. Ask for the name as many times as you need to,
and don’t be afraid to ask to have it spelled out if that will
help.
Now that you’ve got the name, it’s time to turn it into a
concept that can be visualized easily. In some cases, the
name will be a recognizable word, or very close to it (e.g.,
Brian = brain, Liz = lizard). In others, it will remind you of
someone you’re familiar with or sound like some concrete
thing (e.g., Bill could be Bill Clinton or a dollar bill). Those
types are easy to work with, and you should have no
problems visualizing them. But sometimes you get a name
such as Shannon, that doesn’t sound like anything or
immediately associate with anything.

Shannon might make you think of Ireland, or maybe Del
Shannon, the singer of the 1961 hit “Runaway.” But both of
those are terrible concepts for remembering names,

#### because they could potentially remind you of too many

names. If you picture Ireland or someone running away, you
could just as easily come up with a name like Kelly or Sean

#### or Del or Julia (as in Julia Roberts in Runaway Bride).

## PRO TIP

**Whether you do it to solidify what you’ve learned or
to flaunt your newfound name-remembering prowess,
put that name to use. You can go over it in your
head, or you can use it in conversation. You could ask
a question and lead with the name (“Tell me,
Shannon: What do you do for a living?”), or you could
introduce the person to someone else (“Shannon,
meet Shane”). When you leave, try to picture the
people you met, along with the mental images that
apply to each, and review their names. If I meet
someone in a business setting and take his/her card,
I like to use a little trick recommended by Dale**

#### Carnegie in How to Win Friends & Influence People:

**On the back, write down a little bit of information—
anything that came up in conversation that you’d like
to be able to reference the next time you meet. It not
only makes you seem like a memory master, it also
makes you appear genuinely, endearingly interested
in that person.**

Don’t get yourself all twisted around with those kinds of
associations. Make things easy for yourself. Instead of
thinking about the whole word, break it down into syllables
and create a concept around what those syllables sound
like. For instance, “Shannon” breaks down into “Shan” and
“on.” “Shan” sounds like “shine,” so “Shannon” = “shine

on.” Unlike a vague association such as “Ireland,” “shine
on” can’t possibly be mistaken for any other name (except
maybe Shane, but you can most likely tell the difference
between a Shane and a Shannon without the help of
mnemonics).

There may be several ways to visualize “shine on”—it could
be Shannon shining a flashlight on her face, a blinding
spotlight shining on Shannon, Shannon shining a lantern in a
cave, or Shannon’s face as the sun, shining down on the
Earth with powerful beams of light.

### GO!

Now you’re chatting away with Shannon, and if you’re on
top of your name game, it’s taken you roughly ten seconds
to **LINK** and **SEE**. But you’ve still got to make the whole
image memorable by meshing it all together and adding
that magical memorable sauce. This last step may be the
most important one, because this will be the mental image
you call upon when you need to remember the name later—
whether that’s in a few minutes or a few years down the
line.
Let’s say Shannon’s most prominent facial feature is her
round cheeks. Your visual scene could be Shannon up on
stage with two spotlights shining on her, each one lighting
up a cheek; or it could be Shannon’s face in the sky where
the sun ought to be, smiling cartoonishly so that her cheeks
puff up (the sun on the Kellogg’s Raisin Bran box comes to
mind here), with rays of light streaming out of her cheeks
and shining down on some anonymous sunbathers on the
beach. (Don’t forget those are some red-hot rays, so make
’em sizzle.)

### LET’S TRY A FEW TOGETHER

**EXAMPLE 1—Donovan**

Are you focused? You should be, since that’s always the first
step. You don’t need blinders and earplugs, but if anything is
distracting you right now, try to block it out. Next we choose
a distinguishing feature. Go with your instinct here (though
the first thing that jumps out at me is this man’s bald head,
and I can only assume that’s what you’ve noticed too). Now
let’s conceptualize his name. Donovan reminds me of
nothing offhand, so let’s break it down: Don-o-van. Don
makes me think of Don Juan, the legendary ladies’ man. Van
makes me think of, well, a van. So my image would be Don
Juan driving a van. Not just any van, though—it’s filled with
pretty ladies who he’s seduced. Now let’s anchor that image
with his bald head. I would picture that packed van driving
all over his bald head. That’s the simple explanation, but I
would also add more depth to that image, such as some
reason why he’s driving around on that particular area.
Maybe because it’s smooth and he can just set the car on
autopilot and take care of some... ahem... business.
Think of the sound that van is making, or better yet, the
sounds coming from inside that van... okay, enough! Get
your head out of the gutter (just kidding, don’t!). And...
we’re done. And in need of a cold shower—but we’ve
remembered his name!

**EXAMPLE 2—Claire**

Alright, Claire... why are you so pretty and plain?
Sometimes it’s not so obvious what to choose as an anchor
because some people might not have any particularly
distinctive facial feature. But she’s got pretty eyebrows,
right? I might latch onto something like that in this situation.
Ultimately it doesn’t matter; choose something you notice—
anything—and stick with it. The name “Claire” reminds me
of the word “clear.” This is going to be a bit of stretch here,
but sometimes that’s what we need to do: I’m going to
imagine that her eyebrows are so widely spaced (which they

#### kind of are) that I can clearly see behind them. Taking it

even further, I might imagine that as I look past her luscious

#### eyebrows, I can see directly through her clear head!

There you have it. That’s how this process works in my
head when I’m trying to remember a roomful of people or
set a new Names & Faces record in a memory competition. I
know most of that might have seemed totally bizarre and
preposterous, but it works: I once remembered all the
names in a room of one hundred people in under ten
minutes! If you’re comfortable with the technique but
worried that you may not be able to do it quickly, don’t fret!
All it takes is a bit of practice to build speed. The more you
do it, the easier and quicker it will become. Whenever
you’re out and about meeting new people, treat it as an
opportunity to practice memorizing names and just do it,
because memorizing names is something anyone can do.

### MR. AND MRS. SO-AND-SO? HAVE HOW MANY

### KIDS AGAIN?

##### HOW TO REMEMBER LAST NAMES (AND OTHER INFO)

Once you’ve gotten the hang of applying the memorization
process to first names, you can start adding last names to
the mix when necessary. And once you’ve added the last

name, you can start adding other information as well
(hobbies, shared interests, any tidbit that may have come
up in conversation that you may want to hold on to).

To add a last name, you need a second concept distinct
from the first name, which you then link together using the
Linking Method described in chapter 2, this page. If
Shannon’s (remember Shannon from this page?) last name
is Carboni, you can break that down into “Carb”—a bowl of
carb-laden pasta—and “oni”—sounds a bit like “only.”
Imagine Shannon’s face is the sun with rays shining out of
her cheeks onto something, but more specifically, onto that
bowl of pasta, and ONLY that bowl of pasta. SHINING ON
CARBS ONLY! Or perhaps Shannon is on stage with
spotlights shining on her cheeks, and she walks across the
stage and sees a bowl of pasta amid a variety of other
foods. She scarfs down the pasta in its entirety but doesn’t
even touch any of the other food. She eats the CARBS ONLY.
Get the idea? It’s just taking that first image you anchored
to the person’s distinguishing feature (the first name, in this

#### case) and linking more information to it into some cohesive

narrative. That’s it! Just remember: Don’t tell Shannon she
shouldn’t be eating so many carbs!
If you want, you can take this method even further. To

#### add even more information about any given person,

approach it with the same process. For example, imagine
you’re meeting someone very important, and you want to
remember not only his first and last names but also the fact
that he loves to play golf (which might come in handy when
trying to charm him later). You come up with images for his
names as usual, then link them together in a little story.
Now take the extra information you want to remember and
turn that (or those) thing(s) into images as well, and link
them all to the images you’ve created for the names.
Essentially, you’re weaving together a (linked) story that will
be entirely anchored on the person’s distinguishing feature.

Obviously, the more information you want to store, the more
involved the process becomes. It’s really just a matter of
focus and spending the time to set those images in your
mind.

### LET’S TRY A FEW TOGETHER

**EXAMPLE 1—Peter Bond**
This guy has a pretty serious dimple on his cheek, so I’m
naturally drawn to that feature. Next, since “Peter” reminds

#### me of Peter Griffin from Family Guy and Bond reminds me of

James Bond, my image is going to be of Peter Griffin dressed
in a tuxedo (that doesn’t really fit his overweight physique)
and holding a Walther PPK pistol, pretending to be James
Bond. “The name’s Bond, Peter Bond,” he says in his New
England accent. Now let’s attach it to that dimple. I’m going
to imagine Peter Bond in the intro to a James Bond film,
where he walks into the middle of the barrel, turns, and
takes a shot, painting the screen red with blood. Only that
shot is going to hit our new friend right in that dimple. Don’t
forget to add as much detail as you can to that image. And
that Bond theme better be playing in your head as you
visualize it!

**EXAMPLE 2—Patrick McDougall who is a huge hockey
fan.**
Patrick has a smooth forehead. That’s going to be my

#### feature! Patrick always reminds me of the action of patting

something down. McDougall makes me think of some kind
of McDonald’s burger but instead of regular beef, it’s dog
meat (Doug = dog), so it’s a McDog (McDoug). The “all” part
at the end doesn’t trouble me; I trust my memory enough to
think I can recover that bit after I recall the rest. Alright,
let’s anchor it as his feature. Picture a dozen dogs
sandwiched in between burger buns resting on his forehead.
To your horror, those dogs are still alive. Don’t eat them!

#### Just pat them gently on their buns.

That takes care of the first and last name, but remember
that in this example we also want to remember that Patrick
McDougall is a big hockey fan. Before we link a new image
to the narrative, it’s important to note that we want to keep
things in sequence here. The first image would be his first
name, which links to the second—his last name—and then
anything after that will be factual information about the
person. I stress this because as we link this new image
about hockey to the dogs in a burger bun, you need to make

#### sure the hockey image comes somewhere after the whole

patting situation. That way, we don’t confuse anything and
you won’t think that his first or last name is hockey, or
sounds like something close to hockey.

Okay! So the simplest image I would think of is someone
swinging a hockey stick (action images are great,
remember?). After we see the dozens of dogs sandwiched in
burger buns on his forehead, which we previously patted,

#### we then grab a hockey stick and whack them off into the

distance. A bit harsh, but those actions... oh ho ho! Boy,
do they stick!

## PRO TIP

**Names are hard, I’ll be the first to admit it. Don’t get
frustrated when you try this method and still forget
the occasional name. I promise that with practice it
will get better. The important thing is to make the
effort. Go to a party with the goal in mind to
memorize, say, ten people’s names. What have you
got to lose anyway?**

- Samuel Johnson was an eighteenth-century English writer. This quote is from
  “Memory Rarely Deficient,” number 74 of 103 essays he wrote and
  published between 1758 and 1760. More notably these days, a painted

  confusion when reading something, aptly named the “What the fuck am I

- You’re probably asking, “What about beards?” On the one hand, beards get
  shorn all the time. On the other, they tend to cover up most other facial
  features, so it’s hard not to use them as anchors. Basically, guys who grow
  beards and then shave them deserve to have their names forgotten—and
  maybe they prefer it that way. KIDDING. Just use their beard as an attribute
  and hope for the best.

##### —SHERLOCK HOLMES\*

Memory storage is like real estate: It’s all about location,
location, location. I’ll spare you the messy details about
hippocampuses and semantic matrices, and put it this way:
Your mind is like a desk littered with all kinds of documents
and supplies. Those things pile up over time, but no matter
how messy the desk gets, it’s never too hard to find the last
thing you put on it—it’s right on top. But that phone bill from
last June? It’s buried somewhere in the darkest depths of
that ocean of paper, and it’ll take a serious search operation
to unearth it—unless you filed it in an appropriate (and
accessible) folder, or color-coded it, or folded it into an
origami swan and put it on a shelf for display.
You don’t need to turn all your memories into origami
swans. If you did that, it would be a lot like turning every
paper on your desk into a swan—very time-consuming to
create, and even more time-consuming to unfold one at a
time until you came across the right one. What you need is

a simple, well-marked filing system. And the way to file
memories properly, the way to put the right information in
the right location, is to create the right associations.

Remember **SEE–LINK–GO!**? Of course you do, you
mnemonic wizard, you. In chapter 3 , we mainly discussed
the very simple memory-use cases of **SEE–LINK–GO!** ,
focusing on the Simple Association approach for the **LINK**
step (see this page).
We’ve got the **SEE** ing part down: coming up with an
outrageous image for whatever it is we’re memorizing. But
it turns out there’s a lot further we can go with the **LINK**
part. In this chapter, we’re going to get more sophisticated
with this step in particular, which is really all about one
thing—storage. I’ll be showing you how to use some fancy
strategies to **LINK** information that is presented to you
specifically in the form of a sequence or list. In the previous
chapter, most of the things we tackled were one-off bits of
information or just simple, single thoughts. Expanding from
that, we’re going to grow your mnemonic strength so that
you can memorize large amounts of information in one go
and retain it for a long time!

```
Before we dive in, though, what am I really talking about
```

#### when I say storage? Storage? In my brain? Yep! In chapter 2

(see this page), I brought up the analogy between our brains
and a computer and how when you save something, you
need to specify a file name as well as a folder/location to
store the thing you’re saving, otherwise you’re in deep
trouble. We need to approach our mnemonic storage in a
similar way, saving everything we can with enough detail so
that we can find it later without a hiccup. Having such
mastery over where memories are stored in your brain
sounds like a thing right out of a science fiction movie, I
know. You might even be thinking to yourself, “There is NO
way I will figure out how to pinpoint a specific location

where a memory sits inside my brain.” But you can, and it’s
easy. Let’s get started.

## SECTION 1 — THE LINKING METHOD

In many situations, you may find yourself having to
memorize large sets of information, not just one thing here
and there. Now check this out: In the same way we took the
one thing we had to remember and associated it with
something else ( **LINK** ed it), what if, as we add more pieces
of information to the set, we associate each subsequent
thing with the previous one, creating one unbreakable chain
of images?

This is the Linking Method.
In short, all you need to remember about the method is
that when you have a list of things to remember, start with
the first thing, **SEE** it, then **LINK** it to the next. Repeat this
process for each item on your list until you’ve gone through
them all. Then, when you want to remember your list,
simply start at the first item in your mind, and, provided
your chain is strong and memorable, the whole list will
cascade back into memory, one by one. The best way to
understand what I mean is to follow along with a satisfying
example. Watch me.

### WHO CUT DOWN THE CHERRY TREE?

##### HOW TO REMEMBER THE U.S. PRESIDENTS IN ORDER

Whether it was all the English kings and queens, the
Chinese dynasties, or the U.S. presidents, you undoubtedly
at one point in your school years had to commit a
challenging historical list to memory. After countless hours
of studying, then having your parents drill you, you took a
test on it at school, only to forget it all as quickly as you

wrote everything down on said test. The whole process most
likely left you exhausted and fed up with your memory. It’s
not fair, because had you been given just a bit of proper
memory guidance, you might actually have enjoyed the
process of memorizing that list. Not only would it have taken
way less time to memorize, it would have been fun too!

Let’s put those bad memory memories aside and learn
how to use the Linking Method. I promise it will change how
you approach memorizing large amounts of information
forever! Using the Linking Method, we can commit a sizable
list, like the U.S. presidents, to memory in one sitting of less
than fifteen minutes (yes, seriously). Normally, memorizing
the U.S. presidents would seem like an arduous task—forty-
five names in all—but by using this simple technique, they
can be learned quickly and without much effort.
Let’s start with the first fifteen presidents. (If you want to
do all forty-five, just refer to just refer to my website
[http://www.nelsondellis.com/memorize-the-presidents](http://www.nelsondellis.com/memorize-the-presidents) for the rest
of the explanation.) First I’ll help you visualize the chain of
images that will represent our images (i.e., the presidents).
Instead of worrying about who or what is linked to what, I
just want you to sit back, relax, and read the little narrative
I’m about to share. The only thing I ask of you is to take it all

#### in and visualize each little scene as best as you can. Got it?

A last few tidbits: We’ll be memorizing fifteen U.S.
presidents, each of whom have a first, middle, and last
name. But we’re going to focus on the last names first. Any
extra information you might want to add afterward can be
done once the main linked list is set in your mind. (I’ll show
you an example or two when we’re finished, but it’ll be
similar to how we memorized names and facts about a
person on this page.) Once that main linked list is set, you
can add the full name and any other fact you want to recall.
Also, as you read through this story, if you’re unsure of why

an image represents a president, just refer to the list of the
images and the reasoning behind them on this page.

#### So where do we begin? With Washington, of course. So

#### let’s start by picturing a WASHING MACHINE

#### (WASHINGTON) washing a ton of bright-green Granny

#### Smith APPLES (ADAMS). Along comes a chubby CHEF

#### (JEFFERSON) who takes the apples out of the washing

#### machine and puts on a MAID ’s uniform (MADISON). He

#### then gets inside a rowboat and starts rowing; he is a MAN

#### ROWING (MONROE). As the chef in a maid’s costume rows

#### downstream, he sees something off in the distance.

#### SQUINTING to see what it is, he sees a DAM (QUINCY

#### ADAMS). On top of the dam is MICHAEL JACKSON

#### (JACKSON) doing the moonwalk and grabbing his crotch,

#### SHAM-OWNNN! A BURNING VAN (VAN BUREN) comes out

#### of nowhere and slams into him; water spurts everywhere,

#### splattering on an innocent bystander who happens to be

#### HARRISON FORD (HARRISON) , who is in the middle of

#### tying his NECKTIE (TYLER). The necktie comes alive and

#### starts POKING (POLK) Harrison Ford in the face. In fact,

#### the necktie pokes him so hard that a TAIL (TAYLOR) pops

#### out of his rear end. Since this is all pretty weird, a FILMER

#### (FILLMORE) begins to document the whole charade on

#### film. But, by accident, the camera that the filmer is using

#### happens to explode, and shrapnel from the camera

#### PIERCES (PIERCE) the back of a cannon lying off to the

#### side of the dam. This lights the fuse of the cannon, causing

#### it to fire and launch a bunch of BOOK-SHAPED

#### CANNONBALLS (BUCHANAN) , BOOM!

I know it’s the silliest story ever and might seem
overwhelming at first, but reread it and really try to visualize
it. I guarantee that if you close your eyes and try to retell
the story after only one or two read-throughs, you’ll have it
memorized. Amazing! Isn’t it incredible how our brains just
absorb that kind of narrative-based, bizarre stuff right up?
Below is the list of images for each president:

```
1 WASHINGTON WASHING MACHINE
2 ADAMS APPLES (AS IN ADAM’S APPLES)
3 JEFFERSON CHEF (CHEF-ERSON)
4 MADISON MAID (MAID-ISON)
5 MONROE MAN ROWING
6 QUINCY ADAMS SQUINTING AT A DAM
7 JACKSON MICHAEL JACKSON
8 VAN BUREN VAN BURNING
9 HARRISON HARRISON FORD
10 TYLER NECKTIE
11 POLK POKING (THE ACTION OF POKING)
12 TAYLOR TAIL
13 FILLMORE FILMER (SOMEONE FILMING WITH A
CAMERA)
14 PIERCE PIERCES (THE ACTION OF PIERCING
SOMETHING)
15 BUCHANAN BOOK-SHAPED CANNONBALLS
```

If you want to further your mastery of this list, one step
you can take is to mark every fifth president in the list with
a number so you can quickly find which president was third,
eighth, or fourteenth, etc., in a matter of seconds. To do

#### this, go back over the story and add the following details: 1.

#### WASHINGTON = First president, on a one-dollar bill

#### (easy)

#### 5. MONROE = Imagine there are five oars attached to

#### the rowboat

#### 10. TYLER = Harrison Ford ties ten neckties around

#### his neck

#### 15. BUCHANAN = Imagine precisely fifteen book-

#### shaped cannonballs being fired

With this system, people can ask you who the eleventh
president was, for example, and you’ll remember Tyler as
the tenth and then move on to the next image in the story
(neckties are poking... poking = Polk!). If someone asks
you for the thirteenth president, you would first remember
Buchanan, the fifteenth president, and then move back two
images in the story (before the books were being fired,
something pierced the canon, and it came from a filmer =
FILLMORE!), etc.

## ADDING MORE INFO

To add more detail to each president, simply take each
image and give it more detail and links to the sub-data you
wish to add. For example, if you continued memorizing the
rest of the presidents, you’d know that the forty-third
president was George W. Bush. In our story, we memorize a
garden bush to represent him. Now, take that image of a
bush and give it more detail. Maybe instead of it being just a
plain old bush, picture George of the Jungle swinging from
tree to tree, and instead of seeing him swinging from a

#### standard rope, picture him swinging from a W-shaped rope.

#### Voilà. It’s not just a Bush anymore, it’s a George W. Bush!

Or what if we wanted to remember that a certain
president died in office, such as Zachary Taylor, who
supposedly died from cholera during his term? How fitting,

#### since the tail (Taylor) that shot out of Harrison Ford’s rear

end happened to cause massive amounts of intestinal
discomfort and diarrhea (i.e., cholera)! That little added
thought process of coming up with some association
between cholera and our image for President Taylor (tail) is
all we need to remember his cause of death.

Another creative way to remember some small similarity
across numerous parts of your list (such as which presidents
died in office) is to decide on some common image that will
represent that fact. In this case, “death” could be imagined
by dousing your image in red paint or incorporating the
color red in some way. Among the first fifteen presidents,
two died in office (there are eight in all).
Let’s take their images and incorporate red in each of
them (it will kind of be like flagging them, so they will be
easy to notice when we are recalling that specific piece of

information):

There you have it! The amount of detail you can add is
limitless and depends on how far you want to take it (we’ll
cover examples of how to tie years and dates to your
images in chapter 6, this page, once you’ve learned a little
more about number memorization in chapter 5, this page).

### WHAT SHOULD I BE DOING?

##### HOW TO REMEMBER TO-DO LISTS

As we’ve seen in the previous section when memorizing the
presidents, the Linking Method can be used as a simple way
to remember a list in a specific order. Remember, the key to

#### Linking is that LINK part. In other words, association: taking

your mental picture of each item and making that picture
somehow interact with the next item. This interaction can
be in the form of an action, event, or reason. Maybe the

#### picture does something to the next, or maybe the picture

causes the next thing to happen, or maybe one picture
shares a very obvious (or not so obvious) connection with
the next picture. It’s up to you! Once you have your whole
story in place, every one of those interactions forms a
bridge that links one point to the next, creating a seamless
sequence so that you never have to make a tangential leap.
So instead of trying to remember ten different things on
your list, you have to remember only the first thing, its

#### association to the next thing, and then that thing’s

association with the next thing, and so on.

## PRO TIP

**As you get more comfortable with the linked story
you create and all its details, the story will eventually
become natural for you to recall, and you might not
even need the story from that point forward.
Remember, a lot of these techniques are designed to
get information in your head quickly. To turn it into
something that is long-term and fluent to a point
where you don’t even need to think about it, review,
review, review! More on this in section 3 (this page).**

As I mentioned before, the Linking Method is best for
situations where you are on the go and don’t really want to
do any prep work. Even though we can use it for a long list

of things (forty-five president’s names), I tend to keep it for
shorter lists that don’t really need to be memorized for long
periods and are apt to change—something like a daily to-do
list, for example. In a few pages, you’ll see why I don’t
typically use it for long-term lists, but for now let’s continue
practicing with our new mnemonic tool!

To-do lists are a perfect use of Linking, since they’re
usually not too long and you don’t have to store them in
your mind forever. Here’s how you would use the Linking
Method to turn a to-do list into an easy-to-remember visual
sequence:

**EXAMPLE—Let’s say your to-do list consists of:**

#### 1. Email Steve back.

#### 2. Work out.

#### 3. Buy some cheese at the grocery store.

#### 4. Pick up mail from the P.O. box.

#### 5. Call Sarah.

```
With the Linking Method, we always start with the first
```

#### item. So for Email Steve back, our image could be typing an

#### email on a stove (stove is our image for Steve because it

#### sounds like Steve). There you are, typing away on the stove.

Maybe the stove is on and your fingers are burning like hell
as you type away. Next, because the stove is so hot, you
keep yanking your fingers away from it. Eventually, because
of the frequent arm movements, it looks like you’re doing
some jumping jacks, flailing your arms above your head and
jumping about. Before you know it, you’re simply doing a

#### workout next to the stove. Once the workout is over, you’re

hungry and the only thing you can grab is some nearby

#### cheese. Unfortunately, the cheese is old and decaying and

doesn’t taste very good, so you pack it up in a box and take

#### it to your P.O. box to be picked up by someone. Before you

#### leave the post office, you call Sarah to come pick up the

box. To help you remember that it’s Sarah who you need to
call, maybe imagine that on the phone call you hear a large

#### crowd of cheerleaders cheering RAH RAH RAH (Sa-RAH)!

## COMING UP WITH IMAGES FOR

## DIFFICULT WORDS

You should have noticed by now that there is a clear
difference between the types of things we are memorizing
in the to-do list and the presidents we memorized before
that. The presidents were a single word (name) at a time,
while our to-do list items were a mix of semi-partial
sentences, actions, varying sets of abstract words, etc.
Memorizing a list like that requires a little more
improvisation when coming up with images, especially since
the words and phrases can be a little more complex. The
way to deal with words or phrases that don’t conjure up
immediate images involves the following three steps:

**1. What does it remind you of?**

#### Let’s use the word liberty, for example. What does liberty

#### remind you of? And I don’t mean what does liberty mean,

because that will just lead you to more abstract thoughts. I
mean, what concrete noun or object does that word remind
you of? Most people (Americans, for sure) would say the
Statue of Liberty. That’s an easily visualized thing I can
concentrate on in my head. Yeah, it’s a little bit more than

#### the word liberty, in fact, it’s two words longer than the

actual word I’m trying to remember! But it doesn’t matter.
Your brain is clever enough to know that the Statue of

#### Liberty is only a placeholder for the actual word liberty.

**2. If it doesn’t remind you of anything, what does it
sound like?**

#### Let’s use the word sworn. Sworn doesn’t really remind me of

anything concrete, so I need to move on to what it sounds

#### like. Sworn, to me, sounds like swarm, which in turn reminds

me of a swarm of bees. That’s my image. I might add a little
more relevance to the image so it relates back to the
original word. So imagine this swarm of bees is sworn to
serve and protect their queen. Voilà, that’s it.

**3. If you strike out on those first two steps, don’t
despair, you just need to break it down into smaller,
more manageable chunks.**

#### Let’s use the word municipality. Maybe it reminds you of

something, or maybe it sounds like something to you, but
let’s assume it doesn’t. Let’s say “muni,” “cip,” and “ality”
are those chunks.

Now, you may not even need the last two pieces to
memorize this word; our brains are really good at picking up
the slack as long as they just have a bit of an association to

#### nibble on. Anyway, “muni” sounds like money, “cip” sounds

#### like sip, and “ality” kind of sounds like a lady. We can now

combine it all into one image: a woman drinking dollar bills

#### out of a martini glass (a money-sipping lady.) I know it may

seem like a stretch, and it’s so far removed from the

#### definition of the word and what the actual word is, but as

soon as you remember the colorful image of a pretty lady
sipping a cash-filled martini, that “money” and “sipping”

#### part will trigger your memory of municipality.

If the item you’re trying to memorize is a collection of
words, break it down into the most important words, or if
you can, into a single word that encompasses the whole
idea. Once you’ve broken it down, apply steps 1 and 2. If
you want to get better at memorizing text and sentences
word-for-word, fret not, as we shall cover that in chapter 6
(see this page)!

### WAS IT A LEFT OR A RIGHT AT THE LIGHT?

##### HOW TO REMEMBER DIRECTIONS

Think of all those times you stopped someone in the street
to ask how to get somewhere. You listen intently as the kind

#### Samaritan unloads a barrage of lefts and rights and turn

#### heres and turn theres. Great. You politely say thank you, he

or she darts off, and suddenly you’re struggling to
remember where to go. Frustrating! Or how about all those
times you entered an address in your phone’s GPS and you
had to keep checking your phone while you drove to make
sure you didn’t miss your exit. Wouldn’t it be nice to just
have those directions memorized so you never even had to
glance at your phone?

Memorizing directions is one of those things that would
be really helpful to know how to do, especially in a pinch,
since it’s usually needed when you’re in a rush or in a fast-
paced situation (driving, in traffic, rushing down the street).
In other words, you don’t get a lot of time to process the
information given to you, so it needs to be memorized
quickly. Since every step in a set of directions follows one
after another, the Linking Method is a perfect solution for
remembering sequences like driving or walking directions.†
The approach is similar to the one we used previously for
our to-do list, but with one key difference: You’re going to

#### get a lot of repeat words. Words like right and left, or go

#### straight, exit there, street, avenue, etc., will most likely

show up multiple times. To deal with those repeats,

#### especially the rights and lefts, come up with some type of

mini-system or preset images beforehand to represent those
things; images that are unmistakable for the things they
represent. For instance, how about for lefts and rights you

#### imagine a verb or adjective starting with the letter L or R

and have that verb/adjective happening to or describing the
image you have for the rest of the direction step?

**EXAMPLE 1—Try out your skills with this route:**

#### 1. From your starting point, go left on Square.

#### 2. Left on Prince St.

#### 3. Right on Hanover St.

#### 4. Left on Bennet St.

#### 5. Right on Salem St... until you arrive at Paul

#### Revere’s house!

#### Here’s what I came up with: I started out with a large

#### Square (Left on Square), licking a Prince (Left on Prince). The

#### prince chugged a red Bloody Mary to cure his Hangover

#### (Right on Hanover), but lactated all over Uncle Ben (Left on

#### Bennet), who ran and jumped in a Sailboat (Right on Salem).

Gross—but memorable! And now, if you’re ever in Boston,
you know how to get from Paul Revere’s house on Square to
the Old North Church on Salem. You’re welcome!

**EXAMPLE 2—Let’s try a slightly more challenging set
of directions with some numbers thrown in (we’ll
have a better control of numbers once we get
through chapter 5, but we can still make do for now).**

Let’s say you’re sightseeing in New York City and have just
tried sneaking into the exclusive (and impossible to get into
unless you own one of the 383 existing keys!) Gramercy
Park‡ and want to explore a more accessible park like
Central Park. I enter the locations into my Google Maps app
on my phone just as I notice I’ve got 1 percent battery left.

#### Uh-oh. Better memorize these directions fast: 1. Head

#### west On 20th St.

#### 2. Turn right on Broadway.

#### 3. Get on the N or R train at 23rd St. heading uptown.

#### 4. Get off at the 57th St. stop.

#### 5. Head up 7th Ave... until you get to Central Park!

Okay, rather than having a bunch of lefts and rights this
time, we have some more complex instructions that involve
numbers. Assuming you are already on 20th Street by the
park, “heading west on 20th St.” isn’t actually too hard a
direction to follow—just start walking. The directions really

start at “turn right on Broadway.” Using my convention for

#### lefts and rights from the previous example, I’ll start my

#### Linking Method story by imagining I’m watching a very racy

Broadway musical—nudity and sexual innuendo abound! As
the musical progresses, one scene in particular showcases

#### Michael Jordan ( 23 is his famous jersey number, so 23

reminds of me of 23rd St.) playing basketball against a team

#### of Norwegians (N-o-R-wegians reminds me of the two train

#### options I have: N or R)—he jumps UP (uptown) over them in

a fantastic display of athletic ability! As MJ lands back on the

#### ground he accidentally lands on an off switch (to help

#### remind you to get off) that turns off 57 of the stage lights,

leaving the entire audience in complete darkness. If 57 is
too arbitrary a number to memorize, split it up and try to
make it more meaningful: Maybe the lights shine only on

#### the first 5 rows of the audience, which happen to be filled

#### with 7 -year-olds... who obviously shouldn’t be at this racy

musical in the first place! Finally, under the cloak of

#### darkness, all those sneaky 7-year-olds (7th Ave.) creep out

#### of the theater and make their way up to the park to play (up

#### and park will remind you to “head up” and go to the “park”).

There you have it!

## PRO TIP

**I know it can feel overwhelming to think that you
would have to come up with a story like this quickly,
on the fly. But trust me when I say that with a bit of
practice and some confidence in your memory, it
really is a lot easier than it may seem. I’m writing all
the details out for you so you can understand the
example, but when you do it on your own, you’ll be
able to do it a lot quicker, without having to read and
visualize what I write in an example. The best thing
you can do is give it a shot and see for yourself!**

## SECTION 2 — THE PEG METHOD

The upside of the Linking Method is that it can be done
quickly and it keeps list items in a very specific order. But
there are two big downsides to the method. The main one is
that it requires you to start at the beginning of a list and go
through everything in exact order. Say you were recalling
the presidents and the first thing you remember is a

#### washing machine (Washington). Maybe you remember the

Granny Smith apples (Adams) being taken out of the
washing machine by a chef (Jefferson), so you know

#### Madison comes next (remember the chef puts on a maid’s

outfit afterward?). But what if you confuse the order of
events somewhere down the chain, or what if you
completely blank on one of the images in the linked chain?
You’re stuck and your list is shot. Unfortunately, the Linking
Method gives you back the information in a one-directional
way. Sure, you have all the items memorized in order, but
you can’t really say the items out of order or jump around
with a precise mastery of all the information. So how do you
keep track of a list in a way that allows you to claim that
mastery?
Hello, Peg Method.
The Peg (or Anchoring) Method is another technique that
essentially corrects for the biggest shortcoming of the
Linking Method by allowing each item on a list to be
remembered independently of all the other items. You still
need some sort of glue that holds all the items together

#### (i.e., that lovely LINK step), but instead of gluing them to

each other, the Peg Method “pegs” each item to an
“anchor” item on another list. I know what you’re thinking:
“Two lists! That’s insane!” You’re right, it would be insane if
you had to memorize a whole other list just to keep track of
the first one, which is what some other memory books
suggest. But I’ll make it much easier for you. So easy, in

fact, that you’ve already memorized that “anchor” list
without knowing it.

If you’re a baseball fan, for example, you have a list of
the different fielding positions (1 for pitcher, 2 for catcher,
etc.) already memorized. If you happen to know the order of
the planets in our solar system (Mercury, Venus, Earth, etc.),
because it was ingrained in you at a young age, there’s
another peg list ready to go as well. Or numbers! We all
know how to count from one to whatever number you want
(one, two, three, etc.), right? There’s another list! Or how

#### about one of the most universal lists that we’ve all already

memorized: the alphabet (A, B, C, etc.)? Basically, anything
that is in the form of a list that you have already memorized
and know well can be used as your peg list. Once you have
a peg list ready, simply follow **SEE–LINK–GO!** , only this
time for **LINK** you’re going to associate your image with an
item on your peg list. The fixed order of your peg list is what

#### will keep the order of your memorized list.

### YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS

##### HOW TO REMEMBER THE KINGS AND QUEENS OF

##### ENGLAND

Just to be fair to my friends across the pond, since I walked
you through memorizing the first fifteen U.S. presidents with
the Linking Method, I thought we could walk through an
example of the Peg Method with the first few monarchs of

#### England. I’d cover all the monarchs, but Britain has had a

pretty long history so that would take up a significant
portion of our book. But don’t worry, I’ll get you started, and
I’ll leave it as a nice exercise for you to try to complete on
your own if you feel compelled to do so.
First, let’s identify the peg list we want to use. I vote for
the Alphabet Peg List, since we all know the alphabet, from
A to Z. If we wanted to memorize the first ten monarchs, our

anchors would need to be the letters A through J. Now, just
having a letter character as our peg isn’t quite enough—it’s
not very memorable, is it? Instead, let’s come up with a very
simple image that starts with the letter.

I like to suggest to first-timers that they think back to the
walls of their kindergarten class. Remember all those
cursive letters? There was usually a letter paired with an

#### image that started with that letter. A was an apple, B was a

#### bat, C was a car—it’s all coming back to you, isn’t it?

It doesn’t really matter what the image is as long as it
starts with the letter you’re interested in and it’s a simple
enough image (I wouldn’t recommend going for words like

#### absquatulate for A or baboonery for B).

Here are some suggestions for A–J:

#### A - APPLE

#### B - BAT

#### C - CAR

#### D - DOOR

#### E - ELEPHANT

#### F - FISH

#### G - GRASS

#### H - HOUSE

#### I - ICE CREAM

#### J - JAR

And now for our first ten monarchs:

#### 1. OFFA

#### 2. EGBERT

#### 3. AETHELWULF

#### 4. AETHELBALD

#### 5. ATHELBERT

#### 6. AETHELRED

#### 7. ALFRED

#### 8. EDWARD THE ELDER

#### 9. AETHELSTAN

#### 10. EDMUND THE MAGNIFICENT

I’ll admit that’s a pretty daunting list with some very
strange yet similar-to-each-other names. But don’t worry!
One thing we have oodles of is that memory confidence I’ve
instilled in you, right? We can do it. All we need to do is **SEE**
each monarch as a vivid image, **LINK** it to the peg image
we have in the corresponding numeric position in our list,
then, as per usual, we **GO!** See the chart on this page for
how I would go about it.

## PRO TIP

**We have a few “Aethel” prefixes on this list, and it’s
probably going to be a tough thing to come up with a
picture for, so let’s preassign it before we begin.
Aethel sounds like “ethyl,” which is a common prefix
in the names of chemicals. Since we typically keep
chemical liquids in bottles, why not incorporate an
image of a bottle to represent Aethel?**

After you have memorized the chart, now what? Well, the
mental process of recall goes as follows (in slow motion, so
you can follow):
You know the order of the alphabet, so you start at A. You
then ask yourself what the word from your peg list is that

#### starts with A (apple), then that image should have attached

whatever image you anchored to it. In our case, a bucket of

#### offal: King Offa! Next, B (bat) helps us remember a baseball

bat was smashing into a crate of eggs: King Egbert! You get
the idea. See if you can recall the rest of the list on your
own.

Pretty impressive, right? What’s even more impressive is
that you can say that list forward or backward (try it!), you
can start at any point in the list, or you can jump to and
from one part of the list to another without running the risk
of losing your place as with the Linking Method. And the
better you know your peg list, the more impressive things

#### you can do with your list. For example, if I know that G is the

seventh letter of the alphabet, then I can jump straight to

#### the seventh king of England: That would be fried grass or

#### King Alfred! I have instant access to all of my memorized

information. It’s like having a proper filing system in your
mind!
As an exercise, see if you can first build out your full
Alphabet Peg List (check out the appendix, this page, if you
want to piggyback off mine) and then memorize another set
of ten monarchs (or heck, finish them all!).

One thing you may have wondered by now is, “But,
Nelson, what if my peg list isn’t as long as the item list I
want to memorize?” Great question. There are a few
solutions. One solution is to group or chunk a few items at

#### each anchor. So instead of A being just for Offa, you can

#### imagine a bucket of slimy offal and cracked eggs filled with

apples (remember of course to create an image that
somehow takes note of the order so you know offal comes

#### first and then eggs). Another option is to think of clever

ways to extend your peg list. In the case of the Alphabet Peg
List, we could have multiple lists using the alphabet but
maybe each list is themed differently. Maybe our main
Alphabet Peg List could be for types of animals, a second
one could be for different foods, and yet a third one could
be sports-related words, and so on. So if my list of kings and
queens goes beyond twenty-six items (since there are only

twenty-six letters in the alphabet), items twenty-six through
fifty-two could be my second Alphabet Peg List, and items
fifty-three onward could be on my third Alphabet Peg List.

### WHAT’S THE PLAN FOR TODAY?

##### HOW TO REMEMBER DAILY APPOINTMENTS AND

##### MEETINGS

Here’s a classic everyday memory lapse: You can’t
remember what time or what day you were supposed to
show up for a meeting or appointment. There just happens
to be another kind of peg list perfectly suited to this
problem. For organizing your daily appointments, you can
use the Days of the Week Peg List. We can use an approach
similar to the Number-Rhyme System and come up with
images that use the sounds of the days of the week. The
most memorable images will be the ones that come to mind
most easily for you, but here are some suggestions:

#### Monday: Mountain, Moon, Monster

#### Tuesday: Tooth, Tools, Toons

#### Wednesday: Wedding, Wet, Wedgie

#### Thursday: Thirst, Third Base, 30 Rock

#### Friday: French Fries, Fraying, Fridge

#### Saturday: Sitting, Satellite, Sad/Sadder

#### Sunday: Sun, Your Son

Likewise, you can keep track of specific times of your
appointments by using a mental image of an analog clock
and overlaying it on some spatial peg list you already know.
One possibility is to use a map you’re familiar with, for
instance, the United States, and then overlay the positions
of the hours from a clock. If we’re taking a bird’s-eye view of
the U.S. map, noon/midnight could be a big city in the
central north, such as Minneapolis. The rest follow in a

#### clockwise fashion. Check it out: 12:00 — Minneapolis

#### 1:00 — Chicago

#### 2:00 — New York

#### 3:00 — Washington, D.C.

#### 4:00 — Charleston

#### 5:00 — Miami

#### 6:00 — Dallas

#### 7:00 — Phoenix

#### 8:00 — Los Angeles

#### 9:00 — San Francisco

#### 10:00 — Portland, Oregon

#### 11:00 — Seattle

The specific places you use don’t have to line up exactly
with the positions on a clock face, and they don’t even have
to be cities: If I have dinner plans at 7:00 and I can’t picture
myself in Phoenix, I just think of being in the desert; if I have
a dentist’s appointment at noon, I might just imagine having
my teeth drilled in the middle of a lake. Whatever it is you
decide to picture, it will most certainly be more memorable
than a nonvisual thought of a plain old number. If you have
an appointment time that is half-past, quarter-past, or
quarter-to the hour, we can come up with simple
adjustments for our images (similar to how we painted
everything red for our dead presidents earlier on this page).
For example’s sake, let’s say right at the top of the hour
(noon, 2:00, 5:00, etc.) will just be the default image—no
adjustments. For any half-past hour (12:30, 3:30, etc.)
appointment, we slice our image right in half. For any
quarter-past (1:15, 6:15, etc.), we add a twenty-five-cent
coin (a quarter) into the image, and for any quarter-to (3:45,
7:45, etc.), we add a Colt .45 handgun to the image. If you
also want to keep track of A.M. versus P.M., maybe just
imagine your image in darkness if it’s P.M. (I wouldn’t worry
about this too much, most appointments are obvious, based
on context—you’re not going to visit the doctor at 10:45 P.M.,

and you’re definitely not getting a haircut at 3:15 A.M.)

#### LET’S TRY ONE TOGETHER

**EXAMPLE—This week I have a doctor’s appointment
on Tuesday at 10:30 A.M., a haircut on Wednesday at
1:00 P.M., and my son’s piano recital on Thursday at
8:15 P.M.**
Using my Days of the Week Peg List, I see that I have
important events happening on Tuesday, Wednesday, and
Thursday. Let’s start by **SEE** ing the Tuesday appointment.

#### My image for Tuesday will be a tooth. Now, let’s LINK it: My

image for the appointment will be some mix of a doctor with
something about Portland, Oregon (10:00), sliced in half
(10:30). Portland makes me think of microbreweries, since
its residents are all about artisanal foods and drinks. And

#### finally, let’s GO! : Picture a doctor having a brewski at a

#### microbrewery and his tooth slices right in half as he takes a

#### sip out of a chipped glass beer mug. OUCH!

#### Next up, Wednesday, where my image is a wedding. I

have a haircut appointment at 1:00 P.M., so I’d better think of

#### my hair being cut and used as an ingredient for a delicious

#### Chicago deep-dish pizza pie. To tie that back to the wedding,

maybe that pizza pie is being baked for the reception of a

#### wedding. Or maybe the haircut is actually happening at the

wedding.
Finally, our last appointment is the piano recital on
Thursday at 8:15 P.M. Our peg image for the day will be

#### thirst. The peg for 8:15 P.M. will be an image of L.A. at night,

#### with a quarter coin somehow worked in. How about this:

#### Your son is playing piano at a late-night jazz bar in Los

#### Angeles (think Ryan Gosling in La La Land) and he’s just

#### scrounging for a quarter so he can buy himself a drink—

#### HE’S SO THIRSTY!

### REMEMBERING YOUR APPOINTMENTS, USING A

### DAY OF THE WEEK PEG LIST

### YOUR BODY IS A WONDERLAND

##### HOW TO REMEMBER THE LARGEST COUNTRIES IN THE

##### WORLD

##### (BY POPULATION)

While the Alphabet Peg List and the Days of the Week Peg
List are great places to start when first applying the
magnificent power of the Peg Method, there is another
amazingly convenient peg list at your disposal: your body.

Choose as many body parts as you like, as long as they
connect in some kind of order that is obvious and
memorable (maybe start at your head and make your way

down to your toes, or vice versa) and you’ve got a portable
peg list! Let’s jump right into an example that uses ten body
parts to memorize ten things. How about the ten largest
countries in the world by population?

Our ten body parts will be:

#### 1. TOP OF HEAD

#### 2. EARS

#### 3. EYES

#### 4. NOSE

#### 5. MOUTH

#### 6. CHIN

#### 7. ARMPIT

#### 8. BELLY BUTTON

#### 9. KNEES

#### 10. FEET

Our ten countries are:

#### 1. CHINA

#### 2. INDIA

#### 3. UNITED STATES

#### 4. INDONESIA

#### 5. BRAZIL

#### 6. PAKISTAN

#### 7. NIGERIA

#### 8. BANGLADESH

#### 9. RUSSIA

#### 10. JAPAN

The first thing we need to do is to **SEE** the countries as
images:

#### 1. CHINA = CHOPSTICKS

#### 2. INDIA = CURRY

#### 3. UNITED STATES = HAMBURGER

#### 4. INDONESIA = IN DOUGH

```
(PRESSING IN SOME DOUGH WITH THE PALM OF YOUR HAND, LIKE A
BAKER)
```

#### 5. BRAZIL = BRA

#### 6. PAKISTAN = PACK OF CARDS

#### 7. NIGERIA = CHEERIOS

```
(NI-CHEER-IA, CLOSE ENOUGH.. .)
```

#### 8. BANGLADESH = BANG!

#### 9. RUSSIA = VODKA

#### 10. JAPAN = POT

```
Then, we LINK and GO! using our Body Peg List. Since
```

#### the items on our list are real things that are actually on our

bodies, go ahead and imagine the images for each country
interacting with your own body parts.

#### 1 CHINA: CHOPSTICKS are resting on the top of your

#### HEAD , drenched in soy sauce and wrapped in some

```
remnants of noodles.
```

#### 2 INDIA: Dripping out of your EARS is a spicy CURRY

```
sauce.
```

#### 3 UNITED STATES: A HAMBURGER patty takes the place

#### of your EYE socket. Maybe a single tear of mayonnaise

```
rolls down your cheek.
```

#### 4 INDONESIA: Imagine pressing IN some DOUGH into your

#### NOSE. Some of the dough seeps into your nostrils and

```
plumes of flour jet out.
```

#### 5 BRAZIL: Like a magician pulling an endless multicolored

#### flag out of his MOUTH , except it’s a sexy, lacy BRA. Ooo

#### la la!

#### 6 PAKISTAN: Resting on your CHIN is a full PACK OF

#### CARDS. Maybe a blackjack dealer is about to deal the

```
cards straight from your chin!
```

#### 7 NIGERIA: CHEERIOS are flowing out of your ARMPITS

```
into a bowl for your consumption. They’ve got that extra
BO tang. Yum!
```

#### 8 BANGLADESH: From out of the deep crevasse of your

#### BELLY BUTTON shoots a bullet, as if from a gun— BANG

#### BANG!

#### 9 RUSSIA: Your KNEES are two potent Russian VODKA

```
martinis.
```

#### 10 JAPAN: Down on your FEET is a burning-hot POT

```
cooking your dinner. Your feet, as a result, are covered in
nasty blisters.
```

There you have it. On your body now lie the most
populated countries in order. Well done!

### GOOOOOOOOAL!

##### HOW TO REMEMBER WORLD CUP HISTORY

Another easy-to-use peg list is a Number Peg List. Although
we haven’t really covered numbers yet (we will, in chapter
5, this page), I’ll briefly show an example of how using this
list works.

#### Again, a great choice for a peg list is any list you know

well. Since we all know how to count, why not use a list of
countable numbers? If we use a Number Peg List, we can’t
just use the image of the number as our peg. No, that’s not
enough. Rather, we need a way to visualize the number as

#### an image, and use that as our peg.

There are two simple options for Number Pegs: the
Number-Rhyme System (chapter 5, this page) or the
Number-Shape System (chapter 5, this page). With the
Number-Rhyme System you use images that come from
words that rhyme with the numbers (one = bun, two =
shoe, etc.), and with the Number-Shape System you use

#### images that look like the shapes of the numbers (1 = stick,

2 = swan, etc.).

There have been twenty World Cup champions since
1930.§ Let’s commit the most recent five to memory using
the Number-Shape System (my personal preference). First,
we’ll have to think of images to represent our pegs 1–5. The
Number-Shape System uses images to represent the
numbers based on what their shapes look like (refer to

#### chapter 5, this page, for the full list). See below: 1. STICK

#### (looks like a stick)

#### 2. SWAN (looks like a swan sitting on a lake)

#### 3. HANDCUFFS (looks like a pair of open handcuffs)

#### 4. SAILBOAT (looks like the sail of a boat)

#### 5. SNAKE (looks like a snake perched, ready to strike)

As for the champions, since they’re all country names,
our images should be something that reminds us of the
country...

#### 1. GERMANY = BRATWURST SAUSAGE

#### 2. SPAIN = BULLFIGHTER

#### 3. ITALY = PIZZA

#### 4. BRAZIL = SOCCER BALL

#### 5. FRANCE = EIFFEL TOWER

Then, we simply **LINK** each image to its corresponding
anchor and **GO!**
Count to five and it will be impossible not to think of the
shape associated with the number, and subsequently the
country that won the World Cup. Using a Number Peg List is
great if you’re in a tight spot, in need of a quick list to
attach images to, but I don’t recommend it if your list is
longer than twenty or so items. Try thinking of words that
rhyme with twenty-three or images that look like the shape
of the numeral 45. Yeah... it’s not trivial, is it? Most
Number-Rhyme or Number-Shape systems that you’ll find

#### go up only to ten, some up to twenty. But past that it

doesn’t really make sense.

Like Linking, the Peg/Anchoring Method makes it easy to
remember the sequential location of information, and it also
adds a layer of defense against interference by associating
each item with a specific position (instead of just associating
it with the item before and the one after). This means you
can jump from one item to another without having to go
straight down the line. But they’re both lacking one
important quality: You can’t store them deep in the recesses
of your mind, long-term, because they’re just stories floating
around with no place to call home. To add in this third
dimension, we need a technique that takes advantage of
our brains’ special ability to remember places and spaces.
I’m talking, of course, about the Journey Method.

## SECTION 3 — THE JOURNEY METHOD

I previously told the tale of the Greek poet Simonides and
how his dinner party came to an abrupt halt when his
banquet hall collapsed on all of his guests, mangling them
beyond recognition. With his eyes shut, Simonides realized
he could spatially visualize where each of his guests had
stood, and as a result was able to identify the bodies. This
was the birth of the concept of the Memory Palace—what I
like to call the Journey Method.
It’s very simple and is reminiscent of the Peg Method we

#### just learned. In fact, it’s actually a very specific use of the

Peg Method, but it’s so much more effective as a technique
that it deserves its own name. The method requires you to

#### imagine a place you know very well (it can be a house you

grew up in, an apartment you currently live in, the path you
walk to get to your grocery store, whatever), then to anchor
the images of the things you’re memorizing to locations
along a path through that place. Instead of **LINK** ing the
images to letters of the alphabet with the Alphabet Peg List,
we will **LINK** them instead to locations on a journey.

While everyone who’s used the technique over the
centuries has come to know how well it works, we’ve only

#### just begun to understand why it works. Since the ’70s we’ve

understood that working memory (the process of taking in
new information and either hanging on to it briefly in order
to use it moments later or encoding it so we can remember
it much later) relies on a “visuospatial sketchpad”^1 to create
the kinds of mental images we remember. In the ’80s,
researchers found that visual and spatial mental imagery
are distinct from each other.^2 And in the early 2000s, further
research showed that presenting people with new visual
information can interfere with their visual memory, just as
presenting them with new spatial information can interfere
with their spatial memory—but visual information does not

#### interfere with spatial memory, or vice versa.^3 In short, if

#### you anchor visuals to locations, you’re less likely to

#### get things mixed up than by anchoring them to other

#### visuals.

Simply put, our brains are hardwired for it! Are you ready
to take a walk through your first memory journey?

### WHAT DO I NEED FROM THE GROCERY STORE?

##### HOW TO REMEMBER A LIST

You’ve just arrived at your local grocery store and you check
your pockets for that grocery list you scribbled down
moments before leaving your house. Uh-oh, it’s not there!
As you rack your brain trying to come up with all ten of
those items you wrote down, you think to yourself how nice

#### it would be if you could memorize your list every single time

you go to the grocery store!? No more getting yelled at by
your spouse, no wasting gas having to make multiple trips,
and no more frustrating groans when you get home and
realize that you forgot the one thing you needed the most.
What memorizing a grocery list boils down to is
remembering a ten- to twenty-item list of mostly one-word
nouns that are easy to visualize (mostly food items, of
course). Both the Linking Method and the Journey Method
work great here, but this is where the Journey Method really
shines.

Before we get into the **SEE—LINK—GO!** process, you’ll
need to decide on a journey to store all of your items in.
Your home should do the trick! And before we step inside
your mental house, I’m going to leave ten grocery-ish words
floating in the ether of your brain. Look at them carefully
and try to remember them—but don’t waste your time
trying to memorize them by rote.
Now, before we start “redecorating” your home with all
these items, we’ll need to turn your home into a journey by

making a mental path through it. Imagine standing at your
front door, then walking inside and going room by room until
you’ve come up with ten different places—one for every
word. A path could be front door > entryway > living room

> kitchen > hallway > staircase > bathroom > cabinet >
> bed > bedroom window, but it all depends on the layout of
> your home. I’m just choosing one for the sake of this
> example, but you’ll want to make your own ones in the
> future. The only requirement is that the path make sense. It
> can’t jump erratically from one room/thing to another—it
> needs to be in some order. Imagine you’re actually walking
> or floating through your home, maybe in a clockwise or
> counterclockwise fashion. Remember to be consistent! The
> path needs to be something you don’t even have to think
> twice about or memorize. Also notice that I sometimes use a
> piece of furniture, and other times a whole room or section
> of a room. Ultimately, it doesn’t matter as long as you just
> decide to make whatever it is an anchor point.

Got it? Now we’re going to follow that path on our first
journey (feel free to grab a pen, cross out my anchor points,
and insert your own, if that makes it easier to envision).

#### Starting at the door—try to picture the door as a massive

#### piece of Swiss CHEESE Don’t forget to GO! with it, so let’s

#### make that cheese super stinky. It’s possibly even so rancid

#### that it’s actually melting down the door.

#### Moving through the door, we find ourselves in the

#### entryway to our home. But alas, it is covered in streams of

#### TOILET PAPER! You even see some rebellious teens

#### running off in the distance, snickering to themselves at

#### having just thrown toilet paper all over your entryway.

#### Moving into the living room, think of a big KIWI fruit just

#### plopped there, where it doesn’t belong. Imagine all the hairs

#### coming out of its fruity skin, and maybe a portion of the kiwi

#### is sliced open and you can see the green insides. Imagine

#### taking a big, juicy bite of that kiwi. YES!

#### Next, in the kitchen, imagine a massive, thick ROPE , like

#### the kind that moors a cruise ship, tied into a lasso, and

#### you’re twirling it over your head. Then you throw that rope

#### around different pots and pans in your kitchen, making a

#### loud cacophony of crashing metal.

#### On to the hallway, where you find your self stepping into

#### a thunderstorm. The hallway is flooded and there is a

#### horrible rainstorm going on. You wade through the ankle-

#### deep water, hearing the splish-splash of the rain and the

#### WATER crashing against your legs and the walls.

#### As you step out from the deluge onto the staircase, a

#### CHICKEN flies in and decides to climb the staircase with

#### you. Imagine the chicken clucking itself along, flapping its

#### wings and leaving a trail of feathers behind.

#### After that, in the bathroom, there’s a giant mound of

#### EGGS piled up on the toilet. The pile has risen so high that

#### it’s almost touching the ceiling. A few of the eggs have even

#### cracked open to reveal baby chicks that are beginning to

#### chirp loudly.

#### In the bathroom is a cabinet, and you open it up and find

#### a seemingly unlimited supply of BEER cans tumbling out of

#### it. Some of them crash to the floor and start fizzing up and

#### exploding open, spraying beer-ish foam everywhere. Don’t

#### forget to imagine the strong smell of beer!

#### Making your way to the bedroom: On your bed there’s a

#### big, shiny silver machine that has just one oversize, red

#### button next to a little slot. You press that button and a juicy,

#### smoky STEAK comes sliding out of the slot. You press the

#### button over and over, and steaks just keep pouring out of

#### the slot. Mmmm... unlimited steak!

#### Finally, across from your bed, coming in your bedroom

#### window is a huge cluster of FLOWERS. Imagine the most

#### colorful flowers you can with dozens of bees abuzz,

#### attracted to them.

There it is! And might I say what a stately, elegant, and
phenomenally weird journey it is. Now, without looking at
the grocery list, go back to the doorstep and retrace your
path, recalling the list of words along your way. Even better,
start in the last room and recall the list in reverse order. Got
’em all, didn’t you? Amazing!

### A MOUNTAIN OF A TASK!

##### HOW TO REMEMBER THE TALLEST MOUNTAINS IN THE

##### WORLD

With my background in mountaineering, I think it’s only
fitting that I teach you all the highest mountains in the
world.¶ If I didn’t, I’d be doing a great disservice to those
massive, ancient behemoths that have inspired so many to
think, create, explore, and climb. Also, think of the parallels
between the Everest of our physical world and the Everest
of your mental memory techniques: the Journey Method.
This method really is the best of the best. It’s the exact tool
the top memorizers use to memorize anything of size and
weight.

One hundred thousand digits of pi? Journey Method.
All the verses of the Bible? Journey Method.
A shuffled deck of playing cards in under twenty
seconds? Yup, the Journey Method.
The previous tip taught you how to memorize a grocery
list using a journey, and now we’ll use one to learn a list of
facts (the names of the highest peaks). What’ll make this list
slightly more challenging than the last is the names of the
peaks themselves, since they are for the most part
Nepalese/Tibetan in origin.

Just a warning that because these names are difficult, I
may not necessarily choose a single word to represent the

image; it might be a phrase or a few words, just so we make
sure to get all the parts of the name correct...

#### 1. EVEREST = RESTING

#### 2. K2 = K9 DOG WITH 2 LEGS

#### 3. KANGCHENJUNGA = CAN JACKIE CHAN PLAY A

#### GAME OF JENGA?

#### 4. LHOTSE = SAYING “LOTS TO SEE”

#### 5. MAKALU = MAKING A LOO

#### 6. CHO OYU = SAYING “LEMME CHO YOU”

#### 7. DHAULAGIRI = DOLLAR CARRY

#### 8. MANASLU = MAN WHO FLEW

#### 9. NANGA PARBAT = MANGO PAR BAT

#### 10. ANNAPURNA = ANNA KOURNIKOVA BURNING

The next thing we need to do is decide on a journey.
Previously we used a generic house; I encourage you to use
one of your own, meaningful journeys, since they will be a
lot more memorable than any generic one I come up with
here. But since we are all learning for the first time together,
let me create another one for you so that we can all follow
along. Why don’t we use the generic backyard illustrated on
the opposite page?
Now that we have our space selected, we need to select
our path through the space and each of the anchor points
we plan to stop at along that journey. We’re going to tackle
the ten highest peaks that reach more than eight thousand
meters above sea level (all in the Himalayan mountain
range, I’ll have you know),\*\* so we will need ten anchor
points—one for each mountain. To save space—and to show
you how to be a little savvier with your mental storage

#### space—let’s pair two mountain names at a time at each

location so that we need only five anchor points.

My journey will start at the left of the picture and make a
short loop in a counter-clockwise direction as shown...

Putting it all together:

#### 1 EVEREST & K2: Under the LEFTMOST PALM TREE , we

#### picture a RESTING K9 DOG WITH ONLY 2 LEGS.

#### Note: It’s important to make sure the resting comes

#### before the thought of the dog. Since we are pairing

#### words, we want to make sure we keep an eye on the

#### order of that pair. We need to rememberEverestfirst, and

#### K2 second.

#### 2 KANGCHENJUNGA & LHOTSE: Beside the FIRE PIT we

#### have JACKIE CHAN playing A GAME OF JENGA while

#### shouting, in his thick Hong Kong accent, “LOTS TO SEE,

#### LOTS TO SEE!!” As an outside viewer, you are watching

```
and wondering, “Hmm, can Jackie Chan play Jenga?” Or
is he going to knock over all the blocks? He seems to be
doing well and is shouting at you that there is apparently
“lots to see!”
```

#### 3 MAKALU & CHO OYU: In the POOL , we have Tony

#### Montana from Scarface, MAKING A LOO (toilet) and

```
telling everyone around him (in his thickest Cuban
```

#### accent, of course), “LEMME CHO YOU.”

#### 4 DHAULAGIRI & MANASLU Splashing out of the JACUZZI

#### is a DOLLAR-CARRYING MAN WHO IS FLYING. This

```
man is flying right out of the Jacuzzi while carrying a
bunch of dollar bills on his chest (remember, order is
important here, so it’s a dollar-carrying man who flew,
```

#### not a man who flew while dollar carrying).

#### 5 NANGA PARBAT & ANNAPURNA: Finally, on top of the

#### POOL BAR you have a golfer putting a MANGO for PAR

#### while using a baseball BAT. He putts the mango

#### successfully into the hole just as ANNA KOURNIKOVA

#### (the famous tennis star) pokes her BURNING head out.

It’s a wild sequence of events, to be sure, but one you’ll
never be able to shake from your memory! If you want to
say this list in reverse, since we paired up images, don’t
forget to say each pair backward.

### HOW MANY TABLESPOONS OF TAHINI?

##### HOW TO REMEMBER YOUR FAVORITE RECIPE

Let’s use a journey to store something practical, like your

#### favorite sauce recipe—in this case, my favorite tahini sauce

recipe. Not only will you get the hang of how to use a
journey to memorize longer, complicated instructions (in
this particular example I’m using a recipe, but the same

#### approach can be used for any type of instruction), you’ll also

know how to make one seriously delicious sauce that you
can pour on just about anything you want. (I mix it in with
some shredded chicken, rice, quinoa, corn, carrots, almonds,
broccoli, and nutritional yeast.) Get ready to have your taste
buds explode!††
Throw all of the following in a blender and you’ll be good
to go:

#### \* 2 GARLIC CLOVES

#### \* 2 INCHES (5 CM) FRESH PEELED GINGER

#### \* 1 TABLESPOON TAMARI SAUCE

#### \* 2 TABLESPOONS LEMON JUICE

#### \* 2 TABLESPOONS TAHINI

#### \* 1 TABLESPOON OLIVE OIL

#### \* 2 TABLESPOONS WATER

As usual, we need to choose a space to create our
journey. Let’s use a generic kitchen (since after all, this

sauce is going to be made in the kitchen). Let’s use the one
illustrated on the opposite page.

We have seven steps of instructions, so we’ll need seven
anchor points along a route through the kitchen. In case
you’re wondering why we’re not pairing steps together the
way we paired mountain names in the previous example,
it’s because these images are going to be a bit more
complex since they are longer than single words. I’d rather
devote a whole anchor to each step so I can really flesh
each one out. Our journey will be from the door on the left
to the kitchen island as shown opposite.

#### 1 DOOR ON THE LEFT

#### 2 FAUCET

#### 3 STOVE

#### 4 MICROWAVE

#### 5 KNIFE BLOCK

#### 6 FRIDGE

#### 7 CENTER ISLAND

Before we start coming up with images, let’s first take a
look at what we’ll be encoding. Most of it is simple food
items, with a measurement and a small number. This recipe
happens to be pretty simple since almost everything is a
tablespoon or two. Other recipes might have an
amalgamation of tablespoons, teaspoons, cups, liters,
grams, and the like. We are no stranger to such added
details. We simply come up with a fixed image for each of

#### them as we see fit. A tablespoon could be a table; a

#### teaspoon could be a teacup; and so on. As for numerical

measurements, the number images can be improvised. (Or
jump to chapter 5, this page, and teach yourself a number
system really quick.) Now let’s come up with our images...

#### 1 2 GARLIC CLOVES: Imagine TWO VAMPIRES (garlic

```
reminds us of those notoriously garlic-phobic villains)
```

#### crashing through the DOOR. Imagine them with their

```
pale skin and fangs.
```

#### 2 2 INCHES (5 CM) FRESH PEELED GINGER: Picture

#### turning on the FAUCET and seeing a miniature TWO-

#### INCH-TALL REDHEAD (or what we affectionately call a

#### ginger) pour out. Better yet, picture me (I’m a 6′6′′ [198

```
cm] ginger) as a two-inch-tall version of myself.
```

#### 3 1 TABLESPOON TAMARI SAUCE: (Tamari sauce sounds

```
a little like tamale, a Hot Tamale—the fierce cinnamon
```

#### chewy candy). Melting on the STOVE is a single Hot

#### TAMALE.

#### 4 2 TABLESPOONS LEMON JUICE: Exploding in the

#### MICROWAVE , picture two bright yellow LEMONS ; lemon

```
juice splattering against the inside of the microwave
window in a flash!
```

#### 5 2 TABLESPOONS TAHINI: Tahini is also a tricky one.

```
Most people just know it as sesame butter. But let’s say
you’ve never heard of it; imagine breaking up the word
```

#### into THE HEINIE. Not exactly the word, but close

```
enough. You pull a massive butcher knife out of the
```

#### KNIFE BLOCK and start cutting off the heinie (your

#### heinie). Why?? Ouch! Remember that your heinie has two

```
butt-cheeks—to help you remember 2 tablespoons.
```

#### 6 1 TABLESPOON OLIVE OIL: Open up the FRIDGE and

#### inside you find OLIVE OYL , Popeye’s girlfriend, nearly

```
freezing, teeth chattering.
```

#### 7 2 TABLESPOONS WATER: Finally, on the CENTER

#### ISLAND , imagine it actually is an island in the middle of

#### two merging oceans of WATER, one on each side, with

```
waves crashing all about.
```

Before you even try to recall, I recommend you start
cooking dinner so you have something to pour the sauce on.
Oh, and you’re welcome.

### SHOULD WE JUST GOOGLE MAP THIS?

##### HOW TO REMEMBER DIRECTIONS EVEN QUICKER!

We already talked about memorizing directions with the
Linking Method (see this page), but I wanted to briefly touch
on memorizing directions with a slight twist using our new
skill, the Journey Method.

### LET’S TRY ONE TOGETHER

**EXAMPLE—Say you’re in Paris, having just finished**

#### seeing the Mona Lisa at the Louvre, and you want to

**visit the Notre-Dame Cathedral just blocks away. You
stop someone on the street right in front of the
Louvre’s entrance and ask (luckily she speaks
English), “How do I get to the Notre-Dame from
here?” She replies, as she points down the road:
“Make your first left onto the Quai du Louvre, go
down, and then on the fourth bridge (or Rue de la
Cité) make a right, keep going straight until you see
the cathedral on your left.” “MERCI!”**
As you hear that, put yourself inside one of your memory
journeys (anywhere you like, actually) and navigate through
it according to each step in the directions (and adding
images to help you remember any street names or extra
details). You might want to start in a room that has access
to lots of other rooms (usually the living room). If you hit a
dead end, no worries—use your imagination and float
through a wall! Ah, the beauty of memory journeys!

So if the first step is “make a left,” imagine walking out
of the living room to the left. Because there is a street name

#### to remember (Quai du Louvre), make sure to add an image

for the name and place it in the room or space you’re
making a left into. “Quai” is pronounced “kay” (as in

“okay”), so why not imagine making a left and suddenly
seeing the entire Louvre with you standing next to it,

#### unimpressed, saying, “Meh, it was okay.. .” (Okay - Louvre

#### = Quai du Louvre). Next, for “go down, and then on the

#### fourth bridge (or Rue de la Cité) make a right,” continue

down the corridor in your memory palace and make a right
into the first room or space available, where you see a
sailboat (to represent the number four) crashing into a
bridge—“fourth bridge.” If you want to remember the name

#### of the street as well, Rue de la Cité (which translates literally

#### to “street of the city”), add a kanga-ROO (Rue) bouncing

#### around a city (Cité) knocking over all the buildings. To recap:

You have a sailboat crashing into a bridge, then right next to
it a kangaroo bouncing on a city. Finally, “keep going
straight until you see the cathedral on your left.” Next,
continue straight for a bit in the current room, and at some
point imagine turning left to see BLAM! That beautiful Notre-

#### Dame Cathedral towering above you. The nice thing about

this process is that you’ll know which room you end up in at
each step, so you don’t have to memorize left, right, or
straight—you just go from room to room.

### THAT FOREVER MEMORY!

##### HOW TO MANAGE YOUR JOURNEYS AND REMEMBER

##### THINGS LONG-TERM

The Journey Method is a simple technique, but a powerful
one—and virtually limitless in terms of how many anchor
points you can choose along your journey. You might be
saying, “Hey, Nelson, I live in a studio apartment. Does that
mean I can store only two things in my memory journey?”
No! Even in one big, open room (or a tiny, cramped one) you
can pick out at least five anchor points: the four corners and
the center of the room. You can also use different items
within the room as anchors: a bed, a couch, a dresser, a

window, a door, and so on. I have journeys that fit in a room,
while others span an entire city.

The important thing to remember is that the Journey
Method works by combining visual memory with spatial
memory, so it’s about the furniture’s location, not the
furniture itself. As long as you have a consistent pattern
(e.g., clockwise, left to right, or some well-defined path),
you can make tiny micro-journeys around the corners of a

#### room. (You can even imagine yourself as a Honey, I Shrunk

#### the Kids!-size person traveling around—think how massive

your journey could be then!) As Boris Konrad (an elite
German memory athlete) likes to say, “I can teach you how
to memorize the U.S. presidents on a bar of soap!”
But this is where the Journey Method further outshines

#### the Peg Method. There really is no limit to how far your

#### journeys can go. Even if you’ve gone through every nook

and cranny in your house, you can still extend a journey just
by walking out the door. Commonly, the Journey Method is
called the Memory Palace Method. While the word “palace”
might make you think “building,” anything from a drive
around the city to a hike in the mountains can be a
“palace,” as long as you can pick out anchor points and flow
through them in the same order every time. For some of my
longer journeys, like the one I used to memorize ten
thousand digits of pi (yup, I did that), I’ll mentally go
through some familiar parts of my hometown of Miami and
pick out several hundred anchor points—every home I’ve
ever lived in, every office I’ve worked in, my high school, my
favorite bookstore, and so on—with all the different rooms
and areas I can recall from those places.

In a case like that, it’s good to write down the whole
journey point by point, so you can rehearse it in your head
before adding the visuals to each point. You may also want
to go to the actual place and walk through it just to make

sure you remember it in enough detail (or use Google Street
View if you can’t get there in person).

The more places you know, the more journeys you can
create. Adding more journeys is like upgrading your brain’s
hard drive—gigabytes of capacity. Use any place that’s
memorable, but especially the places that are meaningful
(personally, I love revisiting Everest base camp, and my
favorite stroll is through Paris). You can use short journeys
for shopping lists and long ones for epic poetry, if that’s
your thing.
What if you can’t come up with a long journey? Should
you combine a bunch of short ones? I wouldn’t recommend
it, unless there’s a natural flow from each into the next.
However, you can subdivide one journey into sections,
which is especially useful for something such as
remembering specific years for events. For instance, I once
did a segment on a TV show where I taught the host how to
memorize every Best Picture Oscar–winning movie by year,

#### starting in 1928 with Wings. Our journey went through the

Vizcaya Museum and Gardens in Miami—for each decade of
Best Pictures we used a different section of the gardens. So

#### to remember the winner from 1962 (Lawrence of Arabia), we

could simply zoom ahead to the ’60s section and jump to
the third anchor point.

### FINDING THE RIGHT JOURNEYS

As I said, your home is a good starter journey. Former
homes work just as well, and I bet you remember their
layouts even if you can’t remember the shape of the dining
table. Your school or office may give you a little more space
to work with. But a journey doesn’t have to be a building, or
a fixed outdoor space. Heck, it doesn’t even have to be real.

#### Let’s say you’re a Seinfeld fan—why not use Jerry’s

apartment as a journey? If you have a favorite movie that
you know by heart, you could use each scene, and its

setting, as anchor points. We’re technically blurring the line
between Journey Method and Peg Method, but it will still

#### work amazingly! If you’re into games like Grand Theft Auto,

#### Minecraft, or Call of Duty, you could use those worlds as

journeys. You can even go to a brand-new place, real or
virtual, and turn it into a journey as good as your home
within five minutes or so, as studies have shown.^4

To begin, my suggestion is to come up with three
journeys, including your home. For each one, find a natural
starting point, whether that’s the entrance or the place you
spend the most time. This is your first anchor. From there,
you can either go around the room and pick out more
anchor points or move on to another room, but you want to
get about ten to twenty anchor points per journey. Try not to
double back to any spots—but if you do, make sure you
view the space from a different angle so that it feels like a
“different” anchor. Before you use your journey to memorize
something, do a walk-through forward and backward just to
make sure you have it all in order. Then it’s ready for action!
But be careful reusing journeys too frequently. Once
you’ve “recorded” mental images along a particular journey,
you can “tape over” the journey later with new information
—but you may get a little bit of interference if you try to
reuse a journey too soon.‡ ‡ For things like to-do lists and
shopping lists, taping over becomes inevitable, especially if
you’re making those kinds of lists every day. If you want to
memorize something for good, such as every Best Picture
winner from the Oscars, pick or create a journey that you
can dedicate to that list and never tape over.

### REVISIT YOUR JOURNEYS

The great thing about the Journey Method is that you can
study something once and it will be uploaded to your
memory super quickly. But as with most things our minds

#### memorize, without review it will inevitably fade. There is

#### no avoiding the fact that if you want to keep

#### information long-term, it’s all about review, review..

#### . REVIEW.

```
Reviewing can be tedious, and it takes time and effort.
```

#### But making something stick long-term is all about efficient

review. Reviewing with the Journey Method is significantly
easier since all you have to do is close your eyes and walk
through your journey. To review smart, you’ll have to apply
Spaced Repetition, which is based on the fact that there
exists an ideal moment to review information you’ve
learned. If you review that information too early, you’ll be
wasting your time; if you review too late, you will forget it
and will waste even more time relearning it. Actually, the
best time to review is right before you’re about to forget it.
It’s tricky to predict when that time will be, and the time will
differ for each person and each piece of memorized
information.
Hermann Ebbinghaus, a nineteenth-century German
psychologist, was one of the first researchers to formulate
notions of learning curves and forgetting curves and the
concept of spaced repetition.^5 The chart looks something
like the one opposite. Notice that the first time you
memorize something, your retention rate will be more or
less 100 percent. Wait a few days, and that rate plummets—
it’s not our fault! Our brains naturally forget most things
over time. But what Ebbinghaus discovered was that if you
review the information shortly after the first round, your
retention shoots back up to 100 percent and the rate of
decay is slower. Do that a second time, and a third, with the
right spacing between sessions, and you essentially
eliminate the rate of decay over time—in other words, you
end up remembering something forever.

Think of it this way: Any memory you have is essentially
an electrical connection between neurons in your brain. If
that connection has been fired up only once or twice over a

long period, it’s not surprising that that connection won’t be
very strong and will become weaker over time. But if you
keep activating and firing that connection (i.e., reviewing
that memory), that connection strengthens. It creates
something of a neural shortcut—a secret backdoor entrance
—between those neurons. The bond between those neurons
grows thicker and soon enough it’s an easy connection to
fire—a welcome old friend, or rather, memory!

Any review in general is helpful for making information
last a lot longer, but true long-term memorizing needs to
follow a mathematical model that takes into account the
true forgetting curve illustrated in the chart.§§ In this modern
age, don’t worry about knowing all that information yourself,

#### because there’s an app for that! Anki, Memrise, and the Art

of Memory are some recommendations (see this page). For
each, just enter the information you’re memorizing and the
app will set reminders to review the things that are on their
way to forgetting-land.

  † Sure, you could rely on turn-by-turn GPS directions, but where’s the fun in
  that? Plus, memorizing directions means knowing ahead of time which way
  you’ll have to turn so you can get in the appropriate lane (if you’re driving),
  and it improves your ability to form mental maps, which comes in handy for
  creating memory journeys.
  ‡ I learned this the hard way when I planned to propose to my now-wife in
  Gramercy Park. Getting a key proved to be impossible, so I ended up just

# Making Sense of the

# Gobbledygook Number Things

# and How to Make Them Stick

#### Numbers have life; they’re not just symbols on paper.

##### —SHAKUNTALA DEVI\*

Look around you—numbers are everywhere. You already
know they’re deposited in your bank, fighting for supremacy
in every sporting event you watch, penciled into your
calendar, and 100 percent crucial to every statistic you’d
like to cite off the top of your head. They’re fundamental to
our identities, and even if you believe “age ain’t nothing but
a number,” you and everyone you know still has one, along
with a whole slew of others by which we measure and
quantify ourselves.

You don’t need to be a statistician, an accountant, an
engineer, or an auctioneer to have an intimate relationship
with numbers; even if you’ve written yourself off as “bad at
math,” you still can’t escape their ubiquity.
But it’s easy to see why numbers give so many people so
much trouble, especially when it comes to remembering
specific ones accurately. They’re too abstract and indistinct
from one another. Even if we can picture their shapes, they
have no color, texture, environment, smell, sound, or flavor.
When they’re small, we might be able to picture them as
tangible quantities, but that effect doesn’t scale: A mental
image of two little pigs looks very different from a cluster of

three, but a group of 102 little pigs looks almost identical to
a group of 103.

Some people who constantly think about numbers, such
as accountants and sports junkies, may have a bit of an
advantage. A number like 49 isn’t random and abstract to a
football fan in San Francisco, and a number like 1099 has
special significance to an accountant. But you don’t have to
be a person who is constantly surrounded by numbers to

#### memorize numbers easily though. Anyone can make

#### numbers more memorable by making them more

#### meaningful.

Just how memorable? Believe it or not, the official world
record for memorizing consecutive digits of pi is 70,030
digits by Suresh Kumar Sharma of India—though Akira
Haraguchi of Japan has unofficially reached one hundred
thousand. In competition, where we get only five minutes to
memorize as many random digits as possible, memory
champion Alex Mullen currently holds the world record at
568, and I formerly held the U.S. record: 339 digits. But this
number changes almost every year. Sure as you’re born,
what seems humanly impossible to memorize in competition
one year eventually becomes standard practice for top
memory athletes.

So how on earth are we number-memorizing freaks
memorizing numbers? I’ll be the first to tell you that most
top memorizers don’t have a proclivity for numbers. It’s not
rocket science; it’s not even math. It’s all storytelling. And
it’s not all that different from everything we’ve discussed so
far—just a simple extension of **SEE—LINK—GO! SEE** ing the
numbers as images is the hardest part of memorizing
numbers. But you don’t need to be able to see numbers
dance around and come together magically the way John

#### Nash did in A Beautiful Mind.

```
You just need a system. And systems we shall create!
```

## SECTION 1 — THE SMALL NUMBERS

When learning how to memorize numbers, what we’re really

#### doing is learning how to memorize different-size sequences

of digits. Now, you may be thinking, “But, Nelson, isn’t a
digit the same as a number?” Well, technically yes. But for
our purposes, rather than thinking of having to memorize
numbers as individual units on a number scale (like 34 or
1,764 or 803,976), we are going to think of numbers as a
collection of digits—the individual numeric atoms that make
up every number in the universe. Thinking about numbers in
this way will save us a lot of mind power and make our lives

#### easier. Think about it: There are only ten digits—0, 1, 2, 3, 4,

#### 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9—while there are infinite numbers. As

numbers get bigger, they’re really just a sequence of digits
growing in length.

By viewing numbers as made up of these ten digits, we
can create some very simple and powerful mnemonic
systems. As with anything, though, we have to start
somewhere, and why not start with all the small sequences
of digits that you need to memorize in your daily life? I’m
talking about single numbers that you need to keep in your
brain while counting pin codes and addresses. Let’s get
started, shall we?

### WHAT LAP WAS I ON?

##### HOW TO REMEMBER A SINGLE NUMBER

Nod if you’ve ever done this: You look up a phone number,†
but to dial it you have to look down at your phone and away
from the number, so you say the number in your head (or
aloud) over and over until you’ve dialed it. It’s a fairly
effective memory trick—holding something in your working
memory for a few seconds, just keeping it in the forefront of
your mind until you need to use it. Sometimes we hold

things in our working memory until we need to replace
them, the best example of which is counting. You need to
remember only the last number you counted, and you can
forget that one as soon as you get to the next.

Using your working memory in that way is like walking a
tightrope with an armload of fine china. One small misstep
and you drop everything. One little distraction pops into
your head and the thing you wanted to remember is gone.
Even if you keep it together, your attention is so wholly
devoted to that information that you’re forced to block out
everything else, even if it’s more important. But it doesn’t
have to be that way.
Counting or, rather, holding a single number in your
memory is one of the simplest forms of active memory. One
of my favorite memory strategies for counting is the
Ventriloquist Technique. I use the Ventriloquist Technique
when I run laps at the gym, where each lap around the
indoor track is 1/11 of a mile and I’m usually counting up to
33 or 44, with each uptick spaced a little under a minute
apart. That’s a lot of counting when you’re running, and I
prefer to space out. When I’ve been going for a little while,
it’s easy to forget if my last lap was the 22nd or the 23rd.
Instead of using my normal head voice to count to myself, I
say each number aloud (or quietly under my breath if I don’t
want to freak out anyone within earshot) in a different voice
or intonation; sometimes I’ll even say it in a different
language. The key is to mix it up each time. I might say one

#### to myself in a deep baritone; two becomes deux in the

sexiest French accent I can muster; three could be in a high-
pitched, nasal voice; and so on. When I ask myself, “Am I on
lap three or four?” I just think back to the high-pitched
three, which sticks in my head well enough that I don’t need
to give it any more attention after I’ve said it. If you have a
hard time coming up with different voices, you can repeat
those you used earlier, as long as there’s no chance of

confusing the instances with the same voice. It shouldn’t be
too hard, though, even if you can’t count in other
languages. Just think about using different pitches, accents,
drawls and trills, robotic voices, celebrity impersonations,
and so on. I know it sounds ridiculous, but remember,
making things crazy/weird is one of those ways you make
something memorable (think back to chapter 3 [see this
page]: It’s the same idea but vocalized).

This technique is quick and effective for when you need
to hold a single number in your head for a moment. In
addition to being helpful during workouts, it can also help
you remember a floor number, apartment unit, or house
number, provided the number is relatively short and
provided that you are relying on that luscious working
memory of yours (i.e., you are needing to hold that item in
memory only for a few moments). While this has its uses, of
course it’s better to be able to hold a number in your
memory for a long time. We’ll get to that in the next
section!

### MORE MONEY, MORE PROBLEMS...

##### HOW TO REMEMBER PIN, BANK ACCOUNT, AND

##### CHECKING NUMBERS

One of the more common necessities of number
memorization in real life is with pin numbers or short
sequences that provide us with access to some of our most
crucial information: our locked cell phones, ATM machines,
gym lockers, etc. Above, I explained how to hold a very
short number for a very short amount of time. Now we’ll
grow your digit-span retention to the next level. It will allow
you to hold a slightly larger number in your memory for as
long as you’d like.
One thing to note as you make your way through this
chapter is that the techniques for memorizing numbers get

more sophisticated as you go. More sophistication brings
both good news and bad news. The good? Bigger numbers
and stronger memory for numbers! (Always a good thing,
right?) The bad? It takes a little more prep time to set the
system up (no biggie, in my opinion). The even greater
news? That each system or method works retroactively for
everything we’ve learned before it. So as you learn a more

#### complicated system, you can then designate that particular

system for all your number-memorizing needs!

As our numbers grow, the difficulty in **SEE** ing the number
as an image becomes more difficult. You can always
improvise, of course. If a number reminds you of something
immediately, then great! You have your image already. But
this way of going about things isn’t always reliable. For
numbers, especially because numbers are so predictable
since they consist of only ten different digits, you need a
consistent encoding system.
Since pin numbers and other similar-size numbers (four
to six digits in length) are so short, we can use one of the
quickest and simplest systems for digits, famously known as
the Number-Rhyme System. Here’s how it works: Each digit
is given a preset image to associate with it based on a word
that rhymes with the original number.

Another version of this simple single-digit system is the
Number Shape System, which uses the shape of the number
rather than the sound. I prefer it because it gives a little
more flexibility for the image choices. Feel free to make up
your own images, but these are my suggestions...

To memorize a sequence of digits, we just string the
objects representing each digit into one memorable story. In
other words, **LINK**! Once you have your story, of course, the
most important piece of the puzzle is finding a way to

#### always remember that that particular sequence is related to

the pin code that gives you access to your bank card, or
your suitcase lock, and so on. To do this, **GO!** Take your
memorable story and mesh it with something related to the
thing the number represents. Don’t forget to make that

#### story out of this world, so you never forget it!

Both of the systems I just outlined are quick and easy to
use. The Number-Rhyme System is probably the quickest
and the least involved in terms of setup; but the images
don’t offer much variety. If your sequence has a lot of repeat
digits, it can become a nuisance to deal with the repeat
images. With the Number-Shape System, the images stay
flexible by leaning toward categories, which is ultimately
why I prefer this system over the former. For example, if you
have to memorize the number 2, you aren’t limited to one
choice. As long as your image is a bird-related animal
similar to a swan, you’ll remember it was a 2. So if you had
to memorize a string of three 2s, for example, you wouldn’t
have to picture three swans; a swan, a duck, and an eagle
could spice that image up instead.

### LET’S TRY ONE TOGETHER

**EXAMPLE—The pin to unlock your cell phone is 1002.**

#### Let 1 represent a pencil, 0 will be a glass marble, the second

#### 0 will be an orange, and the 2 will be a swan. Our story will

be as follows: You’re working on an assignment and on your
desk is a massive pile of pencils, ready for your immediate
use. You pick up one of the pencils to start writing and as
you press the tip to the sheet of paper, a glass marble rolls

out from under it, across and off the table, from which it
drops to the floor and hits an orange that is lying there,
causing it to start rolling into the mouth of a nearby swan.
Totally ridiculous, I know. But memorable!

Next, we **LINK** it to your cell phone somehow. This
bizarre story is now one of the most viral videos of our time,
gaining more than a trillion views in just hours! Of course,
your friends text you the video, so imagine viewing this
bizarre viral video on your cell phone.

### 6480 SW 6... WHAT STREET AGAIN?

##### HOW TO REMEMBER AN ADDRESS

You’ve been in this situation before. You’re out with your
friends and you all decide to head over to a party that
everyone and their mother is at. Someone gets the address
via text, and suddenly everyone is getting in their
respective cars while the address is being shouted back and
forth from car windows. You’re about to enter it into your
GPS device, but suddenly everyone has driven off and
you’re now asking yourself, “Wait, what was the address
again?”

The numbers will be encoded using the simple one-digit
system you learned for pin codes, and for the words we will
use what we learned in chapter 4 (see this page).

### LET’S TRY ONE TOGETHER

**EXAMPLE—Your new job’s office location is 12412 SW
91st St.**
Okay, this one has quite a few digits in it. But no problem!

#### Let’s revert to our Number-Shape System. Let 1 be a stick, 2

#### will be a red bird, a cardinal (because why not?), 4 will be a

#### cruise ship, 1 will be an arrow, 2 will be a duck.

Since I’m using the Number-Shape System, which has
categories, I’m just going with whatever suits my fancy in
the moment. Notice that our number has two repeat digits.
We could have kept the same images for both instances, but
with more variety, the more unique and memorable the
entire story becomes.
So our story for this first slew of digits could be you
standing there with a stick in hand, swatting at a cardinal
that is flapping all about you. Finally, the bird flies away and
perches on a passing cruise ship, gets shot with an arrow
(ouch!), and as we trace the arrow back to its owner we see
a duck holding a crossbow, laughing maniacally at what he
just did (not cool, duck).

Next, we have SW, which you know stands for Southwest.
If you didn’t know that, we can always come up with a
picture for SW—maybe the word “SWeat?” Then we have

91. The 9 could be a balloon on a string and the 1 is a pin
    that is popping the balloon. Finally, we need to remember

#### Street. We can just picture a street.

Let’s put it all together and then connect it to the
location. Let’s start by picturing you at your office desk, in
front of your computer swatting at that cardinal with a stick.

Then the story continues from there. Bird goes to cruise
ship. Arrow shoots bird. Duck is the shooter.

Then we add the rest.
As the duck is revealed as the shooter, covered in SWeat,
he tosses his bow aside and grabs a big red balloon by the
string and pops it. He then flees the scene and flies to the

#### nearest street to get in his car and zoom off.

```
An elaborate story, but yet again, unforgettable!
```

## SECTION 2 — THE MEDIUM-SIZE

## NUMBERS

In the previous section, we discussed a few different easy
ways to remember one-digit or small-size numbers. They’re
fairly rudimentary, but they work (and in fact I still use them
when memorizing simple everyday things like pin codes).
But I don’t use them for anything over four or five digits,
because even though I’m a pro, I still abide by one of the
most basic principles of memory for all people: The less
information you have to remember, the better. If I see the
number 961574, I don’t want to try to remember “balloon-

golf club-stick-snake-snowman-sailboat” when I can simply
think of “my best buddy Noah writing on a chalkboard with
a sword.” That’s only one image, whereas with the one-digit
system I’d need at least two or three, and possibly up to six.

These images aren’t arbitrary—they’re all part of the
same number system I referred to earlier, with the elephant
on the tractor and James Bond, Tony Blair, and 50 Cent at
the gym (see this page). I’ve assigned images like these to
every different two-digit number, so that when I see a
certain number I immediately associate it with that image.
Likewise, when I recall a series of images from one of my
memory journeys, I can quickly translate them all back into
their respective digits.

#### Learning a number system is much like learning a

#### language. Say you’re learning French and you’ve just

#### learned that the word chien means dog. At first, you’ll study

that French word and mentally file it. The next time you
encounter it, you’ll take a second to think about it and
translate it to the English word. Then and only then will you
be able to picture what that word represents: a dog. After a
good amount of usage of the word, that middle step will
begin to disappear, and suddenly you’ll find yourself seeing
the French word and immediately having a picture in your
mind of what it means. Similarly, after studying your
number system, the translation will eventually become
effortless; you’ll be number-fluent. And if you put in that
effort, you’ll have that number system for the rest of your
life. I guarantee it’ll pay off every time you cross paths with
a big number you need to remember.

Shortly, I’ll walk you through the process of coming up
with your own system, using my personal favorite “number
language,” the Person-Action-Object (PAO) System. But I
want to give you options, since your number system will
truly be your own creation and will depend entirely on using
your own frame of reference. Sometimes, coming up with

memorable images is a matter of combining elements of
two number languages when one leaves you stuck. So
before we get to the PAO System, I’ll walk you through the
Major System.

### CAN I CALL YOU SOMETIME?

##### HOW TO REMEMBER HIS OR HER PHONE NUMBER

Think about this for a moment: How many phone numbers

#### do you actually know by heart, your own aside? Probably

none. Scary, right? Although I bet if you do remember one

#### or two, it’s a number you learned a long time ago, back

when you had to remember it because the alternative was
having to look it up in an analog phone directory (GASP!).
Step back for a second and let that sink in for a moment...

#### you remember a phone number from years ago, yet you

don’t have a number of recent importance stored in your
mind.

A quick, snarky response to that might be “But, Nelson,
why should I bother remembering a single number, when
my phone can remember unlimited ones for me?” Fair point.
But for one, you’re reading this book because you want to
have a better memory, and a better memory takes practice,
so make the effort! For two, you probably find phone
numbers hard to memorize (and easier to store in your

#### phone) because you never try to memorize phone numbers

anymore. If I can make memorizing numbers easier for you,
then what do you have to lose by trying?
And listen, I’m not suggesting you never store a phone
number in your phone again. I’m all about using devices to
help manage our lives. But how about memorizing a number

#### first, then maybe later entering it in your phone? And when

calling someone, when not in a pinch, try to recall it from
memory. Those small little details will do wonders for your
number-memory prowess—and could save the day if your

phone battery runs out. Now let’s get down to the technique
side of it...

Storing a phone number is a little trickier than storing the
types of numbers we tackled earlier in this chapter, but only
because they are slightly longer numbers and because of
the increased frequency with which we are given them and
use them. Unless you’ve got some freakish natural working
memory, you probably won’t be able to keep a phone
number in your head just by saying it in your head (and if
you can, I doubt you could remember it for very long). But
don’t worry! We humans are all basically designed that way.
Remember, the average amount of information we can hold

#### in our working memory is about seven items, plus or minus

#### two,‡ so don’t feel bad!

Even if you’re familiar with the area code, you’re still
looking at seven pieces of information. One way to think
about a phone number is that it’s just a list of seven items.
You already know how to store lists efficiently using either
the Linking Method (see this page) or the Journey Method§
(see this page) and now all you need to do is turn those
abstract digits into something concrete that you can
visualize.

Aside from assigning each singular digit an image, as we
did with Number-Rhyme or Number-Shape systems, the
simplest way to remember a telephone number is by trying
to look for patterns or recognizable strings of numbers
within the actual number and to group or chunk them
together (grouping multiple digits together to represent one
thing is what we call “chunking”). For people who aren’t
very good with numbers or have no interest in anything
numerical, this can be quite difficult. People who are avid
runners (obsessed with times for marathons, half-
marathons, miles, etc.), analysts, sports fanatics, or

#### accountants (you get the idea) can probably extract some

meaning from a string of digits. In a famous memory study

at Carnegie Mellon University,^1 in which college students
were tested repeatedly on their digit span capabilities
(numbers were recited to them aloud and they had to see
how many they could remember), one participant was
initially capable of storing only seven digits at a time but
gradually managed to get to a mind-boggling eighty-two
digits (without any memory coaching)! How’d he do it? He
happened to be a competitive long-distance runner, and
after a bit of practice with the memory task he started
imagining parts of the numbers as times he ran a marathon
in or the distance in feet of a run he knew very well, etc. He
was essentially linking all the numbers into a long,
meaningful story about what he loved: running.

Check this out. If I ask you to glance at the following
number (I’ll admit this is absurdly long for a phone number,
but stick with me.. .) and memorize it, you probably won’t
do so hot:

#### 0 9 1 1 2 0 0 1 1 2 0 7 1 9 4 1 0 6 0 6 1 9 4 5

But what if I told you that it was actually three important
dates from American history?

#### 09-11-2001 12-07-1941 06-06-1945

#### WTC ATTACK PEARL HARBOR D-DAY

That was a heck of a lot easier, right? Almost zero effort.
Suddenly that number has tons of meaning and is almost
unforgettable. Isn’t that incredible? From one moment to the
next: forgettable, then UNFORGETTABLE. There are two
things at work here: First of all, we just turned the numbers
into something meaningful; secondly, we grouped the
numbers into manageable, date-size chunks, so that the
number became three things instead of twenty-four things.

If you can, try to look for chunks of numbers that remind
you of famous (to you, anyway) or familiar numbers and link
them into a quick little story. If you need the number stored
a little more permanently, refer back to that beast of a
technique, the Journey Method (from chapter 4, this page),
and store them properly.

```
Now, let’s get into the good stuff.
```

### THE MAJOR SYSTEM

To really become proficient in memorizing numbers, we
need to be able to read them as easily as we read words.
We’ll get into some more complex number systems further
on, but if you want a system that can be your go-to when
you find yourself in a fix and need to remember a number
instantly, then the Major System¶ is your best bet—and it
takes only a few minutes to learn!

```
The basic principle of the Major System is to turn each
```

#### digit you want to memorize into a consonant sound. By

connecting those consonant sounds and stuffing any vowels
that make sense in between and around those consonants,
you can create strings of words that you can then visualize
and store.
I know numbers can seem intimidating, but honestly the
hardest part of this system is remembering which
consonants represent which numbers—and it’s actually a
breeze to learn. Watch! On the next page are the ten digits
and the consonant sounds they represent. I’ll even share a
quick mnemonic to help you remember each one.

Okay, so once that’s memorized, then what?
To take a number and turn it into a word based on the
Major System, simply study the number and figure out
which consonant sounds the digits represent. At this point,
you won’t have a word; it will just be a jumble of consonants
(and not that memorable).

The next step is to squeeze in some vowels wherever you
like and feel is appropriate to turn that mush of consonants
into a real word. Think of it this way: Vowels are free, and

#### consonant sounds stand for numbers. Since it’s a phonetic

system, the spelling doesn’t really matter; it’s all about the
sounds. For example, a word like spaghetti, even though it
has a lot of letters, only represents four consonant sounds: s
(0), p (9), g (7), and t (1). The h is silent, and the extra t is
technically a part of the single t sound in the word. The
words can be as long or as short as you want, which is one
of the advantages of this system—you have tons of
flexibility.

## THE MAJOR SYSTEM

#### 0

```
s, z, or
soft c (as
in “cider”)
```

#### The Z in “Zero” should make

#### you think of the sound

#### 1 t or d

#### Both t and d Require you to

#### write one downstroke, which

#### looks like the number 1. t and d

#### also share a similar sound

#### 2 n

#### Because n has two

#### downstrokes

#### 3 m

#### Because m has three

#### downstrokes (also, flip that 3

#### over and you’ve got an m!)

#### 4 r The last letter of four is R

#### 5 L

#### If you hold up your left hand,

#### which has 5 fingers, the shape

#### between your pointer finger

#### and thumb makes an L shape

#### 6

```
j, sh, soft
g (as in
“ginger”)
```

#### 6 looks like A G; SH, J, and soft

#### G are lumped together because

#### they sound similar

#### 7

```
k, hard c
(as in
“cash”),
hard g (as
in
“gamble”),
ck, q
```

#### The capital K, when rotated 90

#### degrees clockwise, looks like

#### two mirror images of sevens

#### back-to-back. see it?

#### 8 f or v

#### The cursive lowercase f looks

#### like an 8; f and v, both similar

#### sounds

#### 9 p or b 9 Looks like a mirror image of

#### p, which looks like an upside-

#### down lowercase b

### LET’S TRY A FEW TOGETHER

##### EXAMPLE 1—86

First, let’s turn these two digits into their possible consonant
sounds. The basic breakdown is:

**(F or V) + (J or SH or G or CH)**

How can we fill in the gaps with vowels to make it into a real
word? Let’s play around with it a bit. There are a few
combinations, but how about: FOG, FISH, or FUSCHIA?
Remember, it just needs to have those two consonant
sounds (forget spelling) when you say it aloud. I like FISH,
because it’s an easy word to visualize.
There you have it! 86 = FISH. If you saw the number 86,
you could instead memorize the word FISH. When you are
recalling your images later on and you come to FISH,
thinking back to your Major System phonetic code, you
simply parse out those consonant sounds (F and SH) and
turn them back into digits (8 and 6... 86!).

##### EXAMPLE 2—35

35 breaks down to:

##### (M) + (L)

We can insert some vowels in and around those letters for a
few choice options of words: MAIL, MALE, MOLE, EMAIL,
MILE, MULE... you get the idea. I personally would choose
MAIL.

##### EXAMPLE 3—27

27 breaks down to:

**(N) + (K or C or G or CK or Q)**

NOKIA, NAG, NOG, KNOCK (that first K is silent, so it’s okay).

##### EXAMPLE 4—323

Let’s go up to a three-digit number. 323 breaks down to:

##### (M) + (N) + (M)

The larger the number gets, the more difficult it is to find
one single word. Try your best, but if you can’t, just break it
down into multiple words and **LINK** those words together.
With these consonants, we have AMMONIUM (double M
counts just as a single M sound, so no worries), or how
about MINI-ME (from the Austin Powers movies)? Or maybe
M&M’s (the chocolate candy)?

##### EXAMPLE 5—961574

Let’s go back to a six-digit number I mentioned before—

961574. The basic breakdown is:

**(P or B)+(J or SH or G or CH)+(T or D)+(L)+(K or C or
G or CK or Q)+(R)**

With six consonant sounds, you’ll be hard-pressed to
come up with a single memorable word, so let’s look at our
options here: If we split it into two sets of three digits (961
and 574), our first half could be PATCHED, BATCHED,
PITCHED, BITCHED, BOTCHED, or BUDGET. Our second half
could be LACKER, LICKER, LIQUOR, LOCKER, or LUGGER. You
can make this work, but there are a few issues. For one, out
of all the first-half options, only BUDGET is a noun, and it’s
not an easy one to visualize. Moreover, the other options
are all one syllable each, which may make you forget the D
sound at the end (unless you’re a Shakespearean thespian
and you pronounce everything in iambic pentameter, e.g.,
“bitch-éd”). The second-half options are better, except
maybe for LACKER, since it’s hard to visualize a person who
specifically doesn’t have something, especially if that
something is a budget. These words are still doable, but
maybe not the most memorable.

So three and three was a bit weak; let’s try two-two-two
(96, 15, and 74). Our first options are now PAGE, BADGE,
PATCH, BATCH, PITCH, BITCH, BOTCH, PUDGE, and BUDGE.
Looks like we have some good choices. I lean lean toward
PAGE and PUDGE. Our middle options are TALL, TELL, DELL,
TILL, DILL, TOLL, DOLL, and DULL. And our last options are
CAR, GRR, CORE, GORE, and CUR. There’s plenty of good
stuff to work with here. You could picture putting a PATCH on
a TALL CAR, or PUDGE Rodriguez (the former all-star
catcher) throwing a DOLL at Al GORE, or Jimmy PAGE (with
his long, curly hair, playing electric guitar with a violin bow)
and the flute player from Jethro TULL (his name is Ian

Anderson, but I have no idea what his face looks like, so I
just picture a hippie in a leather vest playing the flute)
jamming out in the back seat of a CAR.

## PRO TIP

**Don’t feel discouraged by this code system. If you’ve
ever had to learn a language, you know that it takes
practice. You have to use it frequently for it to
become internalized—in other words, for you to
become fluent. So with a bit of practice, reading
numbers as words, and words as numbers, will
become easy. Numbers are everywhere, so when
you’re bored in traffic, try converting the license
plates around you into words! It’s great practice.**

```
Alright, shall we try our first phone number together?
```

#### Let’s start without an area code or assume you know the

area code already.

**EXAMPLE 6—Nelson, the tall ginger sitting at the bar
—his phone number is 298-2926.**

Our number breaks down to:

**(N) + (P or B) + (F or V) + (N) + (P or B) + (N) + (J or
SH or G or CH)**

Since it’s a longer number, let’s just break it into smaller
segments so we can find words quicker. 29 could be NAP, 82
could be VAN, 926 could be PINCH. So NAP-VAN-PINCH. Just
think of taking a NAP in a VAN and getting PINCHed to wake
up. That’s the image for the phone number, but how do we
tie it to the person it represents? Well, in this scenario
you’ve met me at the bar. It all depends on what you
learned about me from our interaction. Maybe it was a quick

“Hey, can I get your number?” In which case, there was no
real interaction and you would have to use my looks and
features as an anchor. Maybe we talked for an hour and you
learned that I’ve climbed Everest three times. That’s pretty
memorable, so that could be your anchor. Whatever your
anchor ends up being, just **LINK** it to your story for the
phone number. Let’s just take my looks as the anchor for
this example. Why not picture a massive red-headed giant
taking a NAP in a VAN and you have to PINCH him to wake
him up?

If you need to add an area code to the number, you’re
just adding an extra small word or two to your story. No big
deal!

## PRO TIP

**When I ask people for their phone numbers, I usually
lead by asking them what their area code is. If it’s
local and I’m familiar with it, I don’t really need to
memorize it, and that makes the rest of the number
easier to memorize. If it’s an area code I don’t know,
then I’ll stop them before they tell me the rest of the
number, and ask them about it—where’s it from? This
stalls them a little bit while I come up with a word for**

**the area code. It also helps me chunk the number
into smaller, manageable pieces. If someone rattles
off a ten-digit number without a pause, that’s tricky
to remember. But if I can break it into three digits—
area code, then another three digits (the first part of
the number), then the last four—I’ll be in good shape.**

By now you may have noticed that taking a sequence of
numbers and trying to find words within it using the Major
System isn’t necessarily a quick process. It can get faster if
you train, but in general you might be spending a lot of time
trying out certain groups of numbers to see if they create a
word or not. One way around this (and a way to get faster at
the encoding process) is to create a fixed Major System.
Decide on a fixed grouping of digits and then pre-learn all
the words for all possible combinations of those groupings.
It’s a bit of work, but it’s worth the effort.

Most people will start with a two-digit Major System,
deciding on a fixed image for 00 and working through all the
two-digit pairs up to 99. For example, 76 is always CASH; 89
is always FIB—you get the idea. Once you have all those
images learned, you can take any number (no matter how
long), split it up by twos, and then use a Journey, Peg List, or
the Linking Method to store the images. To see my
suggested fixed two-digit Major System, head to the
appendix (this page).

### DON’T FORGET YOUR PASSPORT!

##### HOW TO REMEMBER YOUR PASSPORT, SOCIAL

##### SECURITY, AND CREDIT CARD NUMBERS

Phone numbers aren’t the only numbers we tend to be weak
at remembering—how about all those other key numbers in
our lives? I’m talking about social security numbers,
passport numbers, sixteen-digit credit card numbers, and

the like. Using the Major System for numbers like these is
doable, but it can be tricky because for larger numbers we
end up with a lot more images to remember. If we’re
remembering a lot of digits, we need to be more mindful of

#### chunking. Remember, chunking is when you consolidate

multiple images into fewer images. The question becomes,
how can I reduce the number of images I need to create?
Thinking in images is great and all, but why memorize four,
five, or even six images for one number, when you can
compress it into just one or two?

```
Another downside to the Major System is that it doesn’t
```

#### have a fail-safe mechanism for remembering the order of

words in an image. Sure, you can picture PAGE and TULL in
a CAR, but what if you misremember it as TULL first, then
PAGE? You can always make the extra effort to really picture
one image happening before the other, but I’ll tell you right
now that this is one of the most common mistakes made in
memory competition—flipping two or three words around.
It’s a killer.
Enter the Person-Action-Object System (or PAO, for
short), my personal favorite and go-to number system for
the majority of things number-related. With this system, we
officially step foot into the world of more formalized systems
—systems that are fixed so that every time you see a
specific number, it is always the same image. As mentioned
previously, these kinds of systems take a little more time to
master because you’ll need to learn all the images. But trust
me, the investment of time in learning this system will
benefit you for the rest of your life.

Using the Major System, we can look at the number
961574 and translate it into Jimmy PAGE for the number 96
(96 = PaGe), Jethro TULL (i.e., hippie flautist) for 15 (15 =
TuLL), and Al GORE for 74 (74 = GoRe). We would then **LINK**
those three images together in a specific order to remember
that the sequence was 961574, rather than 159674 or

749615. However, with PAO, rather than using three distinct
        images and linking them together, we are going to stick to a
        formula of Person first, Action second, Object third. Every
        image we create is going to adhere to that structure. What

#### you’re left with at the end is one picture that, yes, has three

distinct components to it but is smooshed into one cohesive
unit that really **GO!** s.

So I would start by imagining Jimmy Page as our Person
(since he was first in the sequence), performing the second
person’s Action (Jethro Tull’s action is playing a flute), with
the third person’s Object (Al Gore’s object could be a globe
because I picture him saving the planet with his

#### documentary An Inconvenient Truth). So if I think of Jimmy

Page playing the flute and globes flying out of the flute as a
result, I know the correct order is 961574. The person
always comes first, followed by some action, ending with
some object. It’s kind of like the game Clue: It was Colonel
Mustard in the library with the candlestick! Again, the
advantages to using this system are:

**1. Chunking** —By consolidating numbers, you get more
bang for your buck. Or rather, more digits for your one
image.
**2. Fixed structure** —Having a fixed structure for your
images, where everything follows the rubric of Person-
Action-Object, helps you during recall. If you can’t

#### remember a sequence, you know it is always going to be

```
a person followed by an action followed by an object,
allowing you to think through all the possibilities.
```

**3. Familiar images** —Because you know all of your images
from 00–99 and because they won’t change, it will help
you nail your number sequences, as well as increase your
memorization speed since you don’t have to come up

```
with new images each time. Also, people tend to be a lot
more memorable than random words (such as the words
you might end up with for the Major System).
```

### THE PAO PHONETIC SYSTEM

Rather than use the Major System phonetic code, the PAO
System has its own optimized code we can use. In a
nutshell, the PAO System is a stripped-down number
language, using only ten letters of the alphabet. Instead of
organizing numbers by shapes and sounds, PAO organizes
them simply by their order in the alphabet, with three
exceptions:

#### 0 O (Easy to remember because a zero is

#### round like an O, duh!)

#### 1 A

#### 2 B

#### 3 C

#### 4 D

#### 5 E

#### 6 S (More common than F, and easy to

#### remember because six starts with S)

#### 7 G

#### 8 H

#### 9 N (More common than I, and easy to

#### remember because nine starts with N)

Now, you may have noticed that in all of my examples
thus far, I tend to lean toward breaking up digits in pairs.
Using the PAO System, we are going to stick to this rule (for

now), so whenever we look at a number we are going to
break it into segments of two digits. This means that the
one-digit numbers from 0–9 don’t exist in this system. We’re
always memorizing in twos, so technically 00 is our 0, and
01 is our 1, and so on. Also, because it’s a two-digit system

#### this means that a set of Person-Action-Object will always

#### span six digits (two digits for the person, two digits for the

action, and two digits for the object). Make sense? Once you
have that phonetic code list in your head, the next step is to
use it to assign meanings to every possible pair of numbers;
that means 00 all the way to 99. And as implied in the name
of the technique, the meanings we are going to come up
with for each digit pair are a person, an action, and an
object. Okay, let’s dive in to create your PAO list!

### FINDING THAT SPECIAL SOMEONE

First, you’ll need to come up with the people associated with
each two-digit number (we’ll work on the actions and
objects afterward). You can do this in three stages. Before
we begin, though, grab a blank sheet of paper and write
down a list of all the numbers from 00 to 99—one hundred
number pairs in all. Let’s start filling out this list, shall we?

### STAGE 1 – IMMEDIATE ASSOCIATIONS

On your first pass, I want you to temporarily ignore the PAO
System and scan all the numbers you wrote down from 00
to 99. Just look at the numbers. Do any of them immediately
jump out at you? 05 makes me think of a $5 bill, which has
the face of Abraham Lincoln on it, so I made him that
number. My favorite number is 12, so I took it for myself.
Another easy one was 66—that had to be Satan. As a sports
fan, I had quite a few stand out: 24 was Kobe Bryant, 23 was
Michael Jordan, and 34 was Shaquille O’Neal.

Even if you’re not a sports fan, you’ll probably still have
some immediate associations. For instance, if you’re a
Beatles fan, 64 might make you think of the song “When I’m
Sixty-Four,” so that can be Paul McCartney. If you want to
work in John Lennon, you could give him 08, as in “Eight
Days a Week” (even though Paul wrote that one too).

As you scan the numbers, if you pause on any for more
than half a second and nothing comes to mind, skip it. You’ll
come back to it later. The point here is to take care of the

#### low-hanging fruit: the numbers that already have a personal

meaning to you without the use of a phonetic code.
Taking care of those immediate associations is important
because ultimately, once you have the whole PAO list
completed, you’ll then have to learn it. And if there are

#### some numbers you just know and don’t need to learn (i.e.,

those immediate associations), the easier it will be to
master the entire list.\*\*

### STAGE 2 – PAO ASSOCIATIONS

Now we’re really cooking! Coming up with images for the
remainder of the numbers will start to get a bit more
challenging, because you’ll have to start thinking a little
harder to come up with people, actions, and objects who fit
the PAO System. With the PAO phonetic code, we won’t be
creating words with consonants and vowels. Instead, we’ll
use the two letters as initials, representing the name of the
person (most of the time). If you get really stuck on a set of
initials, you can still skip it and come back to it in Stage 3.
Even though the “P” in “PAO” stands for “person,” you
should think of it in the loosest possible sense. For instance,
with the number 06, I couldn’t picture anyone with the
initials O.S., but seeing those letters made me think of Mac
OS X and therefore of Steve Jobs. 80 is H.O., as in “Ho! Ho!
Ho!” so that’s Santa Claus. Be careful with things like 75,
G.E., which might make you think of General Electric but not

necessarily any particular person with a noteworthy action

#### and object; it’s key to come up with people first, not things.

Sometimes you may have to tweak certain people a bit in
order to make them more memorable. When I was creating
my system years ago, I made George Clooney (G.C. = 73)
into Batman—because even though his performance as

#### Batman in Batman & Robin was utterly forgettable, George

Clooney as Batman was still way more memorable than any
of his other roles (at least to me). Another one is 35, C.E.—
Clint Eastwood—but I don’t picture him in his everyday life, I
think of him as the Western gunslinger “Man with No Name”

#### from The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. 36 is C.S., which I

#### associate with the video game Counter-Strike, which I used

to play using a sniper character, so a generic sniper is my 36.
Those are just a few examples from my own system, and
you should feel free to use them if they work for you. But
the most important thing is to be able to quickly take a
number, translate it with the PAO System, and instantly
know which person corresponds to those two letters.

### STAGE 3 – FILL-INS

After two passes through all one hundred two-digit numbers,
you may still find some blanks. Maybe if you think hard
enough, the letters will remind you of something, and
maybe you’ll decide to make a few exceptions where you
use the Major System to come up with people. Or as a last
resort, you can refer to my starter list in the appendix (see
this page) for a bit of help. Chances are, no matter who you
put in those spots, you’ll need to practice your system for a
little while before you start to quickly make the connection
between those numbers and their associated people. My
best advice, then, is to try to come up with the people and
characters who are the most distinct and memorable to you:
friends, family, current and former significant others, unique

movie and cartoon characters, even pets. Assign those to
your remaining numbers and just learn them.

### WHAT NOW?

Now that you have your complete list of one hundred
people, you’ll need to go back over each one and think of
what their associated actions and objects are. Remember,
the way PAO works is that each two-digit number represents

#### a person, an action, and an object. The way I want you to do

it is by imagining the person in question and asking
yourself, “What do I automatically think of this person
doing?” Then ask yourself, “What object comes to mind
when I think of this person doing that action?” For example,
let’s say you decided that 16 was going to be Arnold
Schwarzenegger (A.S. = 16). If you asked yourself what
action you pictured Arnold doing, you might instinctively
think of him lifting weights. What about his object? A
barbell, of course! So then we have the number 16

#### representing three things: Arnold, weightlifting, and a

#### barbell—person, action, object. Based on the number’s

position in a six-digit chunk, if 16 shows up as the first two
digits, it’s Arnie (the person). If it shows up as the middle
two digits, it’s someone else (whoever the person is
represented by the first two digits) performing the action of
lifting something (Arnie’s action). Then finally, if it shows up
as the last two digits, it’s someone doing some action with.

.. a barbell (Arnie’s object).

How about Albert Einstein (A.E. = 15)? I picture him
scribbling on a chalkboard and his object being said
chalkboard. So 15 is now Albert Einstein, writing on a
chalkboard, and a chalkboard. All three things are linked
together, you see, so you don’t really have to memorize
anything extra.

Your actions and objects should be mostly intuitive, but
you might have a few stragglers where you’ll have to do a
bit of research or make some stretches to assign a unique
action and/or object. More important, make sure that all of
your actions and objects are unique. You don’t want two
different numbers claiming to be the same action or object
because that will make it a nightmare for recalling numbers
—how will you be able to tell the difference? Yes, I know it
seems that coming up with one hundred actions or objects
might be challenging, but it’s not. You might come up with
actions or objects that are very similar, but as long as they
are not the exact same thing you should be fine. For
example, in my PAO list, both 35 and 36 have shooting as
their actions and guns as their objects: an old revolver, held

#### in one hand, that makes a loud bang sound versus a rifle,

#### held with two hands, that makes a whizzing zip sound. Very

similar, but distinct enough that I can tell them apart

whenever I go back over a journey and come across one or
the other.

Now that you have a complete two-digit number system,
give yourself a pat on the back for being so committed to
memory (pun intended!). How do we use it? As I mentioned
before, whenever we see a sequence of numbers, we break
it into chunks of six. Each chunk of six then gets broken into
three parts: two digits for the person, two digits for the
action, and two digits for the object. If I was looking at the
number 163515, I would break it into 16-35-15. Then,
referring to my PAO list, I picture the person associated with
the first two-digit number, the action associated with the
second, and the object associated with the third. In this
example, our person is Arnold Schwarzenegger (16), our
action is shooting (35—remember, 35 is C.E., or Clint
Eastwood, but because it is the second pair of digits, we use
his action), and our object is a chalkboard (15 was Albert
Einstein, whose object was a chalkboard). Put it all together
and you get a seriously unforgettable image: Arnold
shooting at a chalkboard!
What can you do with this system now that you’ve
learned it? Well, there’s a lot you can do straight off the bat
—but remember, you might be a little slow at encoding and
translating the numbers when you first start. The speed will
come with practice. The more you use the system, the more
number-fluent you’ll become.

```
Coming up with the images is all well and good, but how
```

#### do you store the numbers? Same as everything else— LINK

it by using an anchor point or a series of them along a
journey. Don’t forget, the memorizing process is always
more or less the same: **SEE—LINK—GO!** But this is where it
gets really fun, because now you’ll get all sorts of weird
scenes happening all over your house (or any memory
journey of your choice).

## PRO TIP

**I would suggest creating a journey dedicated solely
to all of your personal numerical data: social security
number, passport numbers, policy numbers, credit
card numbers. If you want to be really organized,
why not choose a room or location in your house that
associates with the thing you’re memorizing so that
it’s quicker to access? For example, maybe I’ll store
the credit card number sequence in my room near
the computer, since that’s probably where I use it the
most when ordering things online. In addition, maybe
I’ll add a little extra image on that location to help**

#### me quickly remember which card it is. If it’s a Bank of

**America Visa, maybe I’ll mentally hang an American**

#### Flag (Bank of America) with Morgan Freeman’s face

**on it in place of stars (I think of Visa when I think of
Morgan Freeman since he narrated those Visa
Olympics sponsor commercials) above the computer.
Maybe my social security number can go near the
filing cabinet in my office, since that number is
something I might file away in my office. You get the
idea.**

### LET’S TRY A FEW TOGETHER

**EXAMPLE 1—Passport number: 432212857**

If we use my system (refer to the appendix on this page),
the number breaks up into: **43-22-12 // 84 – 7**
Notice this number isn’t a perfect series of six-digit
chunks. That’s okay; for that last set of three I’ll simply use
the person and then maybe use the Number-Shape System
to come up with a quick action or object image for that sole
last digit. Those chunks translate to:

#### 1. A MAGICIAN CRYING ON A RUBIK’S CUBE.

#### 2. LARRY DAVID HINGING A BOOMERANG.

Now to store it. If I was using my backyard as my
memory journey, I’d imagine a magician sobbing incessantly
all over a Rubik’s Cube on the back porch. Then as I
progress down to the pool next to the porch, I see Larry
David throwing a boomerang to himself as he wades in the
pool.††

**EXAMPLE 2—16-digit credit card number:
4758402678314509**

If we use my system (refer to the appendix on this page),
the number breaks up into: **47-58-40 // 26-78-31 // 45-09**
Notice this number also isn’t a perfect series of six-digit
chunks. That’s okay, for that last set of four I’ll just do
Person-Action. Those chunks translate to:

#### 1. AN ALIEN CLIMBING A PLAYING CARD.

#### 2. BRITNEY SPEARS EATING A SLICE OF PIZZA WITH

#### BANJOS AS TOPPINGS.

#### 3. DUKE ELLINGTON DOING JUMPING JACKS.

If I was using my standard house as my journey, I’d
imagine the alien climbing a card on top of my bed (first
location of my journey), Britney Spears eating a slice of
pizza with banjos as toppings while sitting on the toilet
(second location), and then Duke Ellington doing jumping
jacks near the closet (third location). Isn’t that absolutely
bizarre? But fun, right? And, above all, it’s memorable.

Once you have a system, you’ll be able to start applying
these strategies everywhere you encounter numbers. I
should mention that even though I’ve shown you a few

different systems for memorizing numbers, they all work!
Some better than others, depending on the situation, but
you can use whichever one you want, whenever you want.
In theory, you could use the PAO System for all of your
number-memorizing needs. It’s up to you. In my opinion,
PAO is fun and leads to some really memorable images, so
that’s what I use in nearly 99 percent of number-memorizing
cases! I mean hey, if imagining Clint Eastwood sliding down
a chimney in high heels helps me memorize my credit card
number, I’m in.

### I SHOULD PROBABLY START THINKING OF WHAT

### PRESENT TO BUY

##### HOW TO REMEMBER IMPORTANT DATES

##### (ANNIVERSARIES, BIRTHDAYS, AND SPECIAL

##### OCCASIONS)

The famous line goes: If you want to remember your
wedding anniversary date forever, just forget it once.
Clichéd marriage jokes aside, you’re now armed to the teeth
with a grab bag of number memory systems to help you
remember important dates. I’ll show you a few ways to do it,
but my favorite is one that builds off the PAO System.
The general approach is as follows. You have a person or

#### an event–some thing that has a date attached to it. That

date is going to be a month and a two-digit number for the
day. Possibly even a two-digit year as well. That month can
be seen as a word (January, February, etc.) or a number
(01–12). So what we will do is come up with an image for
the date—either a four-digit combo (month, day) or a six-
digit combo (month, day, year). Once you **SEE** that image,
**LINK** it to the person or event that the date reminds you of.
Then **GO!**

### USING A MIX OF THINGS

Let’s say you’re not interested in mastering one of the
number systems from this section. Are you out of luck and
doomed to never remember a date again?? Nah, of course
not. There’s always a work-around. (I highly suggest using a
number system, such as Major or PAO, but if you’re totally
number-phobic and refuse, just do your best.) First, the
month. Instead of looking at it like a number, think of an
association with each month—maybe a big holiday that
happens during the month, a color that the month evokes,
or whatever comes to mind. July might make you think of a
big bright yellow sun because it’s smack in the middle of
summer. February might make you think of a big pulsing
heart because of Valentine’s Day. November? A turkey
gobble-gobbling his way around a coop. Then, for the
number representing the day, do your best to come up with
some image related to it. The 12th might make you think of
midnight or lunch time (12:00). A 13 might make you think

#### of unlucky 13 or the movie Friday the 13th.

### LET’S TRY A FEW TOGETHER

**EXAMPLE 1—Your cruise vacation leaves on August 18.**
August reminds me of back to school. So my image for
August will be a little kid wearing his backpack and school
uniform. Not using any of my number systems, 18 makes
me think of an angsty eighteen-year-old. So my image for
the date will be a little kid decked out to the nines in back-
to-school gear, but he’s going in as a senior, surrounded by
eighteen-year-olds. Next, we **LINK** that image to the event
so we can remember what that date represents—in this
case, the cruise. Let’s imagine this kid, and the first day of
school is on a cruise ship. Putting it all together and adding
a little bit of **GO!** to it, let’s take it further and say that
maybe the kid shows up for school and the seniors (all
eighteen-year-olds, of course) have played a senior prank in

which they placed a massive cruise ship (don’t ask me how)
on the football field.

Now when someone brings up the cruise, I’ll immediately
think of the cruise ship on the high school field as a senior
prank. I’ll think August (school kids) 18 (eighteen-year-old
seniors). There you have it: August 18 is the cruise!

### USING THE MAJOR SYSTEM

Using the same technique as in the previous example, we
now have the added advantage of knowing how to translate
numbers into words.

**EXAMPLE 2—Your wedding anniversary is October 8.**
October is the tenth month of the year, which translates to:

```
(T or D) + (Z or S)
```

Some of my word options here are: TOES, TAS, TEASE,
DAZE, DAYS, DOZE, DOSE. I like TAS as in Tasmanian devil.
For the day, let’s look at it as the two-digit number 08 so we
can create a word from it:

```
(Z or S) + (F or V)
```

My options: SOFA, SAFE, SAVE, SEIVE. I like SOFA. When I
put it all together, my image—TAS, SOFA, and my wedding
(I’ll picture my wife in her gorgeous wedding dress)—has me
picturing my stunning bride walking down the aisle only to
be met by a Tasmanian devil spinning and thrashing to
threads a sofa that happens to be up at the altar. I’ll never
be able to erase that crazy image from my mind, and as a
result I’ll be in good standing with my wife every year when
we come around to October 8! Phew!

## USING THE PAO SYSTEM

I love this approach because it’s so elegant and simple. The
only downside is you need to have your two-digit PAO
System all set and learned. PAO almost feels like it was

#### perfectly designed to memorize dates! Use the actual

person that the date refers to as the anchor point (if it’s an
event, think of some person related to the event) and have

#### them perform the action that represents the two-digit month

with an object that represents the two-digit day. (See this
page for my full PAO list, which I’ll use in the examples to
follow.)

**EXAMPLE 3—My mom’s birthday is July 24.**

July is the number 07, the day is 24, so I’ll always picture
my mom sipping on a martini filled with basketballs (07-24).
So fannnncy!

**EXAMPLE 4—An important networking event is on
November 1.**

November is the number 11, the day is 01, so I’ll picture my
boss running an event while playing tennis with an ax (11-
01). Yeah, he has an anger management issue!

**EXAMPLE 5—Same networking event, but let’s add a
time: November 1 @ 7:30 P.M.**

We have the image for the event and date, but how can we
add the time? Let’s just add an extra small detail to that
image to represent the time. I’ll think of 7 as an object (07 is
that James Bond martini glass). Rather than use our image
for the number 30, let’s just think of any half hour as cutting
our object in half! Let’s recap. We have your angry boss
setting up and running an event while playing tennis with an
ax. He’s swinging that battle-ax around like it’s a tennis
racket. One of the objects of his wrath happens to be a

#### martini glass that’s sitting there by itself on a table. SHLINK!

It gets sliced right in half! Martini-half, Martini-30, 7:30.
Voilà!

## SECTION 3 — THE COMPLICATED

## NUMBERS

There are a few instances where we need to deal with
numbers that are a lot more complicated. I mean numbers
that have letters and/or symbols mixed in—yikes—or
numbers that are really, really long—double yikes! Both of
those situations can make things a lot more complicated,
but they’re nothing our set of skills can’t handle with a bit of
strategy.

### P@55WORD$ @R3 H@RD. HELPPPP!

##### NEVER GET LOCKED OUT OF YOUR ONLINE ACCOUNTS

##### AGAIN

It seems that every week I’m checking out some new site
that asks me to set a password. Even the ones I don’t use
anymore still have a password on file for me. And even
when I think I’ve come up with the perfect, uncrackable
password (&V&5TyeM@EY$, for example), I find out that
hackers have new-and-improved methods to beat my kind
of system, and I have to change it again. Before I started
learning memory techniques, I couldn’t even keep track of
which sites I’d changed my password for, much less keep
track of a unique password for each site I used. I know I’m
not the only one; this kind of frustration is so universal that
I’m dedicating multiple pages of this book to overcoming it.
But don’t despair! There’s a simple antidote, and the
memory skills you’ve built up so far have prepared you to
implement it.

A few years back, security consultant Mark Burnett
published a list of the ten thousand most popular
passwords, pulled from various public sites where hacked
databases have been shared. Do you know what the top
three passwords were? “Password,” “123456,” and
“12345678.” If you just said, “Hey! That’s what I use!”
you’re obviously not alone—and in fact, 9.8 percent of the
six-million-plus username/password combos that Burnett

collected included one of those three combinations. Much
further down the list you can find passwords like “rasta420,”
“trousers,” and “booyah.” Unfortunately, these are just as
hackable as “password.” You don’t want your password to
be one of the ones on Burnett’s list—or one from any of the
many, many lists of already-been-cracked passwords
floating around. They may be memorable, but they’re
definitely not good.

#### A good password is not just memorable but also

#### unique and hard to crack. And as hackers amass more

and more lists and use more and more computing power, it
takes increasing complexity to create a good password.
Don’t worry, there’s a way to come up with complex
passwords you can still remember, and we’ll get to that
process in a moment. First, though, we need some basic
guidelines for creating really strong, unhackable passwords.

..
**1. Go long** —The longer your password, the longer it will
take to crack; anything under seven digits can be
cracked in minutes, whereas adding an extra few digits
can take years or even millennia.
**2. Randomize** —Any sort of identifiable sequence of
characters such as a word, a date, or even a keyboard
pattern (e.g., “qwerty”) can be a giveaway. Even if you
string four common words together, it’s not much more
effective than stringing six or seven random characters
together. And if someone is going after you personally,
the first things they’ll try are words (such as your alma
mater) and dates (anniversaries, relatives’ birthdays) in
your public social media profiles.
**3. Be unique** —Don’t just create passwords that are
different from the ones everyone else uses. Create

```
unique combinations for every website you use—or at
least the ones that carry sensitive personal information
(such as email, banking, and social media accounts).
```

If you really wanted to create the most absolutely
forgettable piece of information possible, it would have all
the attributes of a good password: a long, random, unique
string of abstract symbols with no dictionary words or
names. Further complicating things, you’d have some
uppercase letters and some lowercase. And to make it even
harder to remember, you don’t get any helpful tips when the
time comes to recall it. Even if you pulled off the
extraordinary feat of nailing fifteen characters in a sixteen-
character string, you’d be just as locked out as you’d be if
you got every character wrong. (There’s no website in the
world that would tell you, or anyone trying to guess your
password, “Wrong password, but good effort—everything
but that seventh character is correct.”)

Symbols, uppercase letters, and all those other password
features that websites require of you these days apply to
the most commonly cited strategy for creating hard-to-crack
passwords: the so-called “Schneier scheme,” named after
prominent security expert Bruce Schneier, who first
proposed this trick back in 2008 in an article for the

#### Guardian newspaper. The process involves turning a popular

phrase into a sort of jumbled semi-acronym, such as
“tlpWENT2m” (“this little piggy went to market”) or just a
random phrase like “WIw7, mstmsritt.. .” (“When I was
seven, my sister threw my stuffed rabbit in the toilet”) or
“Wow, doestcst” (“wow, does that couch smell terrible”). It’s
a really good strategy for long, random, unique passwords.

.. but a terrible strategy for making memorable ones. How
do you remember which letters to capitalize? How do you
remember which words to spell out? And if you use the

Schneier scheme repeatedly for different sites, how do you
remember which passphrase is the right one for each site?

Fortunately, we know plenty about how to make random,
abstract information more memorable—by converting it into
mental pictures and creating anchor points for storage. So
how do you apply the principles of **SEE—LINK—GO!** to
passwords? You could apply them any number of ways, but
the one crucial factor is that you apply them consistently,
with the same system for every single password you create.
If you were to use a Number-Rhyme System for some
passwords and a Number-Shape System for others, you’d
confuse yourself as much as any potential hacker. But you
don’t have to spend too much time trying to invent your
own system. You can just use a simplified version of my
favorite system: Person-Action-Object, or PAO, which we
discussed earlier in this chapter, on this page. This process
not only allows you to create easy-to-store, easy-to-
remember mental pictures and stories; it’s also the best
way to chunk bits together (i.e., multiple pieces of
information in a single mental image) while keeping the
order straight. But don’t worry, I’ll walk you through each
part of the process. Let’s get started!

### SEE

When you use the PAO System to come up with a password,
you have the luxury of choosing any people and actions you
want (the objects are a little less flexible, but we’ll get to
that shortly). In theory, you could start off by coming up
with a string of letters, numbers, and symbols that fit the
pattern, then figuring out what to make them stand for. But
it’s better to pick memorable, distinct people, actions, and
objects and then abbreviate them. I’ll explain how to come
up with all the components—but for the sake of reference,
here’s what a PAO password will look like in the end:
CXc^JEJs$Me8.

If you notice the pattern, it’s that there are one, two, or
three capital letters, followed by a single lowercase letter,
followed by a symbol or number, and then all of that is
repeated twice. The story behind this password is: Charles
Xavier (aka Professor X from X-Men) climbing a mountain,
James Earl Jones skateboarding on a snake, and Madonna
eating a snowman.

The first thing I did was come up with three memorable,
unique people. For me, this is the way to go: choose two or
three people, give them each actions and objects, and then
work on deconstructing them into password-ready form. You
don’t have to use my formatting rules (make up your own, if
you like!), but I will always:

**1. Use all capital letters for the initials of my person. 2. Use a single lowercase letter to represent the first**
**letter of my action. 3. Use a single non-letter character to represent**
**what the object looks like.**

So, here is the password, explained piece by piece:

Charles Xavier is easy to remember because I can picture
him in his wheelchair with light glistening off his shiny, bald
head. James Earl Jones has his large, opera-singer-like torso,
and I can imagine hearing his deep, booming bass voice,
plus he has three initials, which is an excellent way to mix
up the pattern. Similarly, Madonna has only one initial, and
she’s wearing her signature cone bra. All of these people
have iconic traits that make them impossible to confuse
with anyone else, though if I focused too much on James
Earl Jones saying, “You underestimate the power of the Dark
Side,” I might misremember him as Darth Vader, and if I
thought too hard about Charles Xavier’s face I might think of
Patrick Stewart, the actor who plays him in the most recent
X-Men movies.

The lesson here is that when you can choose anyone you
want, choose carefully, and be consistent. Don’t abbreviate
your mom with the letter “M” and your dad with his real
initials. You can abbreviate someone like Ronald McDonald
as “RMcD” (instead of “RMD” or “RM”) if you want, but if you
decide to use that abbreviation convention make sure you
also abbreviate Rosie O’Donnell as “RO’D.”

### LINK

Once you have your image for your password, in order to

#### create a truly memorable password that’s unique not only to

you but also among your other passwords, you need to have
some kind of clue or reminder that will **LINK** you to the
thing the password unlocks. As we discussed in the previous
chapter, the Journey Method is a powerful technique
because it allows us to anchor information in places we’ve
already memorized. With PAO (refer to the previous section
for a quick refresher, if necessary), we typically use the
Journey Method, but for a password—especially when you
may go weeks or months without typing it—it’s critical that
you have either a journey or some other type of **LINK** that’s

strongly associated with the website it pertains to. If you
use one password for Google, another for your bank,
another for Facebook, etc., you’ll want to choose a **LINK** for
your Google password that you specifically associate with
Google, a **LINK** for your bank associated with your bank,
and so on. With a little bit of variety, we can do for
passwords what we did in the first section of this chapter for
remembering a pin code for a specific bank card (see this
page). There are three ways you can do this:

**1. The Direct-Association Memory Journey**

This is the simplest **LINK** , but it works only for certain types
of sites. A direct-association memory journey is the brick-
and-mortar equivalent of a site. For instance, when you
visualize your PAO story for your bank password, you should
start at the entrance to your local bank branch; for your
work email, start at the door to your office. Pretty easy,
right? Of course, you might not have a physical space
associated with something like Google or Tumblr, so for
those you may want to use...

**2. The Indirect-Association Memory Journey**
An indirect-association memory journey can be a strong
storage method, but there’s a big catch: The indirect
association itself has to be memorable enough to remind
you of the right journey. Google may make you think of
California, which then makes you think of a beach, so you
could use your quintessential mental image of a beach as
your journey for that site. But will you make the connection
Google > California > Beach every time you’re prompted for
your password? You can always use your imagination to add
a little extra flair to the journey—so perhaps Google’s
rainbow-colored logo makes you think of a rainbow-colored
beach.

**3. The Logo Journey**

This may be your best bet for those hard-to-define sites that
don’t immediately make you think of any particular real-
world place. It’s pretty simple to come up with a logo
journey: Just set your mental movie on top of, around, or
inside the website’s logo. This requires a bit more diligent
visualization to really reinforce it, since a logo doesn’t have
the same sensory richness as a real-world location. But it
does have a well-defined structure to it—and since your
password visualizations need only three scenes each (three
different people, each performing an action with or to an
object), you can easily incorporate those scenes into any
logo.
Take the Amazon logo, for instance: It’s fairly simple,

#### consisting of the word amazon with a yellow arrow pointing

#### from the first a to the z. (Get it? It also looks like a smile. Oh,

those clever graphic designers.) It may not seem like the
ideal playground for a bizarre, memorable scene, but just
think of all the possibilities: the first person summiting the
top of the “a,” as if it’s a mountain peak, or sliding down off
it; the second person buried in the notch between the two
arcs of the “m,” or using the yellow arrow as a skateboard
ramp; the third person trapped inside the “o,” or driving a
train straight toward you through the tunnel-like “n.” You
could picture everything happening on the logo as is, or just
take a key element (such as the arrow, as a skateboard
ramp) and picture a more lifelike equivalent. The best part
of the logo journey is that it’s right there on your screen
every time you have to log in.

### GO!

You may have noticed that the actions I chose for my
password had a lot to do with the Amazon logo journey I just
described. I could have made Charles Xavier pop a wheelie

in his wheelchair, or made James Earl Jones do backflips. But
there are two very good reasons why I didn’t. The first one is
obvious, which is the actions’ connections to the logo
journey. Even if I hadn’t entered my password in a year and
the images had faded from my mind a bit, the shapes within
the logo would serve as helpful reminders of what I
imagined taking place on them. The second reason is all
about interference: What if I used “pop a wheelie”—would

#### that be a p? A w? Or paw? Would the backflips be b or just f

#### for flips? Don’t leave yourself any opportunities to get

confused. Try to use the simplest verbs possible for actions,

#### such as jump instead of leap, or throw instead of fling.

As I said before, you can choose any people and actions
you want—though some are better than others, and there
are some you want to avoid altogether. When it comes to
choosing objects, your range is much more limited—this is
because in order to keep a consistent system, and to
integrate numbers and symbols that make passwords
harder to guess, you need to choose objects whose shapes
roughly correspond to the shapes of symbols on your
keyboard (for example,! could be a baseball bat, ^ could be
a hat, and ~ could be a worm). Fortunately, there’s plenty to
choose from. Along with the ten numerals, you have twenty-
two symbols and the spacebar, though some sites won’t
allow certain elements, such as spaces and parentheses.
Since some of these look similar to one another (such as the
hyphen and the underscore), you shouldn’t come up with
objects first and then arbitrarily assign characters to them.
You should either avoid those similar characters altogether
or come up with a system in which you dedicate one or two
specific objects to each character. If you make up a system,
write it down for reference (or you can use my system in the
appendix on this page) and save it somewhere handy such
as your wallet or in a note on your phone (don’t worry, it

won’t make your passwords more hackable unless you’re
writing down your specific journeys too).

## PRO TIP

**If you want an even more fail-safe way to keep track
of all your different passwords, but you don’t want to
take the risk of writing them down and then losing
that paper, you can create a dedicated journey just
for them. LINK them with the methods above, but
then also create a memory journey for those same
images, so they have a secondary place to live.**

## A LITTLE EXTRA SAUCE...

In case you’re wondering why your passwords should have
three PAO sequences or three people doing something, the
short answer is: because math. Password cracking depends,
to some extent, on processing power. But someone using a
regular desktop computer could crack a six-character
password in about a minute, a seven-character password in
about an hour, an eight-character password in about five
days, and a nine-character password in about five years
(which is to say never, since I don’t believe there’s a
computer out there that can run for five years straight
without crapping out somewhere along the way). Even if
someone knew you were using the PAO System and tried
only capital letters for the names, only lowercase letters for
the actions, and only numbers and symbols for the objects,
he would have to go through roughly the same number of
combinations as a totally randomized nine-character
password (and that’s if you used two initials for every
person in every sequence; the three-initial and one-initial
people make this way harder). You could make things extra
super-duper secure with a fourth PAO sequence, but it’s

probably not necessary (at least not until computers, and
thus cracking attempts, get much faster) and it may exceed
the character maximum on some sites.

So it’s up to you now: You can stick with “123456,” or you
can take a couple minutes to come up with a journey, three
people, three actions, and three objects. You may want to
take a little extra time to practice logging in and logging out
a few times, to reinforce your journey in your mind, and if
you want a backup you can always write your journeys down
on paper and store that paper somewhere safe. You can also
keep your passwords fresh in your mind by making a point
of trying to recall them even when you don’t need to enter
them—for instance, when you visit sites like Gmail and
Facebook that keep you logged in for extended periods.
No matter the state of your passwords at this moment,
now you have the mental technology to rebuild them:
longer, more random, unique, and—most important—
unforgettable.

### TEN THOUSAND DIGITS OF PIZZA PI?!?

##### HOW TO REMEMBER NUMBERS AS LARGE AS YOU

##### WANT!

You probably will never find yourself face-to-face with a five
hundred-digit, ten thousand-digit, or even one hundred
thousand-digit number that you have to memorize, but you
never know! At this point, with everything you have learned

#### in this chapter, you actually have the skills to memorize any

size number you want (yes, even a one hundred thousand-
digit number, believe it or not!).

Memorizing a large number is something we memory
athletes constantly find ourselves doing. Whether it’s for
Speed Numbers, where we have to memorize as many digits
as possible in five minutes (my personal best is 339 digits),
or Marathon Numbers, where we have to do the same in one

hour (my personal best is 1,555 digits), we approach the
numbers the same way. To memorize a massive number,
you’ll need to make sure you have enough locations on your
journey (or enough journeys) to store all the digits you plan
to memorize (that’s really the hardest part, to be honest).
You’ll also need time. The larger the number, the more
review you’ll need once you’ve done all the storing in your
memory journey.

Back in 2016, for World Alzheimer’s Day, I made an
attempt to break a world record in memorization of the
number pi (3.1415926.. .).‡‡ I had ten thousand digits of pi
memorized, and the record was for me to be able to respond
to any five-digit sequence chosen out of the ten thousand
digits of pi with the following five digits and previous five
digits... fifty times, with no mistakes, in under 16 minutes
and 32 seconds (the current record). To get ten thousand
digits in my head didn’t take very long. I broke it up into
groups of one thousand and memorized one group a day for
ten days. Getting the numbers in my head was easy, but
what took the most time was reviewing everything.
I’d close my eyes and fly through my massive array of
journeys. Of course, by the time I had memorized the last
set of one thousand, what I reviewed was a lot less fresh
than the newer stuff. So with a good amount of daily review,
I was able to keep on top of all ten thousand of those digits.
My point being: When the number of digits gets that large,

#### you need the time to review them all... a lot, especially

when you’re first learning them.

In addition to time and journey storage space, increasing
your two-digit system to a three-digit system is a useful
tweak to help you chunk more digits together (more
chunking equals fewer images). If you’re using a PAO
System, it’s quite a leap to go from one hundred
people/actions/objects to one thousand, but the payoff is
that you can cut your total number of mental images (each

PAO chunk at each anchor point) by a third, enabling you to
go faster and store more numbers with shorter journeys.

#### Some people increase only their PAO people up to one

thousand and leave the actions and objects at two digits
(which gives you a nice chunk of seven digits per image—3-
2-2—instead of six digits per image—2-2-2). Some (like me)

#### increase their PAO people and objects up to one thousand,

and the actions up to 100. (I chose these conventions
because I didn’t want to come up with one thousand distinct
actions.)
My approach for jumping from one hundred people to
1,000 is to use a category system. I take the original two-
digit number and give it a unique category so that I can
assign related images to each of the nine other numbers
that include the original two digits in the three-digit number.
For instance, since 15 (or 015) is Albert Einstein, every
three-digit number that ends in 15 fits into the category of

#### Albert Einstein, which I’ve decided is famous scientists. With

the first digit providing a letter-based clue using either the
PAO System or the Major System phonetic code, when I see
the number 815, I know it’s a famous scientist whose name
starts with either H (PAO System) or F or V (Major System)—
both options for representing the number 8. My 815
happens to be Richard Feynman (8 = F, Feynman starts with
F), whom I can picture easily—but since I couldn’t come up
with nine scientists, I expanded the category to include a
few characters from one of my favorite science-fiction

#### movies, Contact.

In other cases, I had difficulty thinking of a category for
that initial two-digit number. For 83 (or 083), there is Bear
Grylls, the adventurer. I didn’t think I knew enough
memorable adventurers to fill a whole category, so I made a
bit of a stretch. All of the 83s became fruits/vegetables
(because to survive in the wilderness, you have to find a
way to eat!). So 183, for example, is an apple (1 = A, my

cue for apple). You don’t have to split things up into
categories, but you’ll learn a three-digit system much faster
that way. It took me almost six months of daily practice to
learn mine.

Others will use a three-digit Major System; that way you
need only one thousand images, which can be a mix of
people and objects (which all depends on your word
construction choice). This might be a more manageable
option if you’re pressed for time, and there are plenty of
Major System word generators on the web to help you come
up with all the words. Once you have those one thousand
images, common practice is to put two images (six digits, 3- 3) in one location or even three images (nine digits, 3-3-3)
per location. I’m not a fan of this method because it’s not as
rigid as using a Person-Action-Object, but some people
prefer the freedom. To each his own. At the high end, both
PAO and Major Systems have been proven in elite memory
competitions to be similarly effective.

## PRO TIP

**You can also use this skill to win bets or free beers at
restaurants and bars. I once bet a restaurant
manager that I could memorize the credit card
numbers of everyone at our table (it was a party of
nine people). He didn’t believe I could and said that if
I did, he would pay our meal tab (which was well over
$650). I did it using this very system and was the
hero of the day among my friends. Have fun!**

### LET’S TRY ONE TOGETHER

I’ll leave the large number-memorizing projects up to you,
but I figure that there’s one particular number that might be
fun to learn as an example: pi to thirty-two digits!

##### EXAMPLE—3.14159265358979323846264338327950

As we’ve seen throughout this chapter, there are a number
of ways to go about memorizing a large number like this. My
system of choice would be PAO. The only down side to PAO
is that it needs a bit of prep work to set up. So, for the sake
of ease in this example, let’s use a two-digit Major System
so everyone can follow along. If you have any questions as
to where I’m getting my images from, refer to the appendix
(this page) to see my complete two-digit Major System.
Okay, so let’s start by breaking up the digits in twos.
Then, to make use of some chunking, let’s group two pairs
at a time. That way, we only need eight total images and
anchor points to store them:

##### 14-15 // 92-65 // 35-89 // 79-32 // 38-46 // 26-43 // 38-

##### 32 // 79-50

Next, I want you to look around. In the very room or
space you’re in, create a journey of eight anchor points.
Starting from where you’re standing/sitting, loop around the
space in a clockwise fashion, ending back at yourself.
Congratulations, you’ve just created your first journey on
your own! Now, let’s store those thirty-two digits there!

Using my Major System (remember, you can look them
up for reference in the appendix, this page), our images are
as follows:

#### 14-15 Tire-Doll

#### 92-65 Pen-Jello

#### 35-89 Mule-Fib

#### 79-32 Cape-Moon

#### 38-46 Movie-Rash

#### 26-43 Notch-Ram

#### 38-32 Movie-Moon

#### 79-50 Cape-Lace

Place that first image of a tire rolling over and flattening
a doll at the first location of your journey. Then continue to
the second location and imagine a pen signing a signature
into some green, wobbly jello. And so on, I’ll let you take it
from here.§§
Isn’t that amazing? Eight silly images and you can
remember a massive thirty-two-digit number forward and
backward.

- Shakuntala Devi is a well-known mental calculator from India. She could do
  impressive feats of memory such as multiplying or taking the roots of large
  numbers. She once successfully multiplied two thirteen-digit numbers in her
  head—7,686,369,774,870 × 2,465,099,745,779. She answered correctly in
  twenty-eight seconds: 18,947,668,177,995,426,462,773,730.
  † Quick history lesson for the youngsters reading this: In the twentieth century,
  believe it or not, we used things called phone books; in the early twenty-first
  century, we used computers that were too big to fit in our pockets and too
  dumb to make phone calls.

[http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Miller.](http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Miller.)
§ The Linking Method works better here if you just need to hold the number until
you dial it. The Journey Method works better if you need to remember that
number for a longer period of time.

¶ The earliest version of the Major System was developed by French
mathematician Pierre Hérigone in the early 1600s. Some believe “major”
comes from Major Beniowski, who published a version of the system in the
late 1800s. The current version of the system (and the one you’ll see here)
was first published by Aimé Paris in 1825.
\*\* Don’t worry if you can’t think of very many (or any!) immediate associations
in this stage—we’ll figure out all the remaining numbers in the next stage.

†† You don’t have to store this number in ajourney. In fact, you could simply
associate the pair of PAO images to something about the passport itself. For
example, maybe the reason the magician is crying is because he’s traveling
away from home and is homesick. Then Larry David throws him a
boomerang in an attempt to cheer him up. Doing it this way is fine, but
storing more complex images like these, in my opinion, are recalled easier
and more accurately with a journey.

‡‡ I had three attempts, and on each one I made a mistake somewhere along
the way. It’s a tough record to beat!
§§ If you don’t feel like learning my Major System images but still want to know a
good chunk of pi digits quickly, memorize this sentence: “How I need a
drink, alcoholic of course, after the heavy lectures involving quantum
mechanics.” The number of letters in each word correspond to the digit in
the sequence (How = 3, I = 1, need = 4, etc.). Knowing that sentence will
give you a respectable fifteen digits of pi. Cool!

# Tips for Memorizing Some of

# Bumfuzzled Brain Has to Deal

# With

#### A man’s real possession is his memory. In nothing else is he

##### —ALEXANDER SMITH\*

Up until now, we’ve been learning the basics bit by bit. But I
haven’t covered everything... yet. Now that we have our
complete set of tools—our strategies for **SEE** ing, our
strategies for **LINK** ing, and our strategies for **GO!** ing—let’s
put them together to learn how to memorize all the other
things that might be of importance to you.
In this chapter, we’ll learn how to memorize speeches
and poems, foreign languages, historic dates, geography,
and what I consider the apex of memory skills: memorizing
a deck of playing cards.

```
So gather all of your mnemonic tools and let’s begin.
```

## SECTION 1 — SPEECHES AND TEXT

Are you feeling ready to take your skills to the Big Stage?
Okay, maybe you’re not quite ready for world-class memory
competition, but you’re just about ready for your own kind
of Big Stage, which may literally be exactly that: a stage.

In our age of PowerPoint, teleprompters, cue cards,
flashcards, and even good ol’ ink and paper, we easily
forget that memory techniques were once the only way for
public speakers to deliver prepared speeches or recite orally
transmitted stories. When the ancient Greeks, around 600
BCE, began to formalize and teach rhetoric, the art of

#### discourse and persuasion, they enshrined memoria as one

of the five canons—or fundamental principles—of rhetoric.

#### The others are inventio (discovery of ideas), dispositio

#### (organization of ideas), elocutio (style), and pronuntiatio

(delivery). Needless to say, speakers today still put a great
deal of thought and effort into content, structure, tone, and
stage presence. But we take memory for granted as
something that comes either from rehearsing and knowing
the material incredibly well or being clever enough to use
the “notes” function in PowerPoint as a sort of cheat-sheet
while presenting.

You don’t have to be a rhapsode,† though, to use your
memory to give better speeches. You’ve probably even done
it before, back in grade school when your teacher made you
memorize a poem, or when you were in the school play, or
when you had to give a big sales pitch. You’ve used your
memory like this before; you’ve probably just used it the
wrong way.

### HE SAID/SHE SAID?

##### HOW TO REMEMBER YOUR FAVORITE QUOTES AND

##### SAYINGS

There is one text-memorizing technique that I have to share
before we go any further, and it will completely blow you
away. I call it the First Letter Method. The simplicity of this
technique is just astonishing and it serves as a fantastic
introduction to memorizing short lines of text, such as a
one-liner quote or a catchy toast. It won’t make things stick

forever unless you eventually apply one of our learned **LINK**
steps, but it’s a great preliminary step to getting a complex
sequence of words into your memory insanely fast. And
once it’s in your memory, you can then apply **SEE–LINK–
GO!** at your own pace.

Let’s get right to it using one of my favorite one-line
toasts (this is a great one to impress your friends next time
you clink your pints together at the pub).

### LET’S TRY A FEW TOGETHER

**EXAMPLE 1—“May we be in heaven half an hour
before the devil knows we’re dead.”**

Alright, first read the sentence in your mind once or twice.
Then read it once or twice out loud. Here’s where it gets
wacky... write down the first letters of each word
(including capital letters, lowercase letters, and any
punctuation):

```
M w b i h h a h b t d k w d.
```

Once you’ve written it down, read from this minimalized
version of the sentence, filling in the complete words as you
go. Nine times out of ten, you’ll be able to read the
sentence perfectly. It’s okay to glance back at the original in
case you aren’t sure of a word. Read the sentence this way
once or twice.
Now close your eyes and try to recite it from memory. It’s
there, isn’t it? Isn’t that absolutely befuddling and amazing
all at the same time? How did our memory just do that?
What always astonishes me the most is how our brain can
fill in all the words just by seeing the first letter of each
word. It just goes to show that if we’re paying attention, we

#### are nearly always memorizing things, even if we don’t know

it; it’s just a matter of whether we can retrieve it or not. The

second most amazing thing about this is how after reading
the text with just the first letters, your brain can remember

#### the whole thing snap, just like that. I’m sure it relates to the

fact that you physically took the time to write down the first
letters so that when you go to say the line from memory,
you have that visual cue of you writing it down fresh in your
visual memory.

**EXAMPLE 2—“Here’s to those who’ve seen us at our
best and seen us at our worst and can’t tell the
difference.”**

Read it over a couple of times to yourself, then once out
loud. Then break it down:

```
H t t w s u a o b a s u a o w a c t t d.
```

Read it a few more times. Now put the book down and say it
completely from memory. MAGIC.

### JUST IMAGINE EVERYONE IN THE AUDIENCE IS

### NAKED

##### HOW TO REMEMBER YOUR SPEECHES AND

##### PRESENTATIONS

If you’ve ever had to memorize a speech—or even the key
points of a speech—by rote repetition, you know that it can
be done that way... eventually. Sometimes, though, that
process can take hours, even days. At a certain point, you
get it down pat. When the time comes to deliver it, you’ve
got a pretty good shot at nailing it—unless you get nervous,
or you suddenly feel tired, or you just get distracted for a
moment and lose your place, then you lose the whole thing,
and you wonder if you’re losing your mind (or your job).

I feel your pain. I’ve had memory mistakes too, and they
burn—especially in front of an audience. At this point, you
probably have a noticeably better memory, which means
fewer mistakes overall. But on the Big Stage you have to
consider whether you need your memory to be 100 percent
perfect—as in knowing a speech, a script, or a poem word
for word—or whether your memory has to be good enough
only to recite the key ideas in their proper order (the

#### essential inventio and dispositio, if you will, so you can save

#### your energy for some rousing elocutio and pronuntiatio).

### WHAT’S THE BIG IDEA?

Let’s leave the word-for-word memorization aside for a bit
and start with “good enough”—in other words, just
memorizing the key topics. If you know your material well,
and you already have the ideas for your talk developed and
structured, you don’t need to use your conscious memory to
elaborate on each idea—you can probably do that off the
cuff. Really, all you need is a list of the ideas themselves,
sorted in their proper order.‡ Hmmm, this sounds familiar,
doesn’t it?

**EXAMPLE—Let’s say you’re getting ready to give a
big talk, titled “Things the Honey Badger Doesn’t
Care About.” You have four main points you’d like to
address:**

#### 1. The honey badger doesn’t care about a snake up in

#### a tree.

#### 2. It doesn’t care about a houseful of bees.

#### 3. It also doesn’t care about getting stung by those

#### bees.

#### 4. Or about a snake saying, “Get away from me!”§

You don’t want to embarrass yourself in front of a roomful
of people; you want to keep your talking points straight, and
you want to go through them one by one, in order. What’s
the best way to keep track of all those snakes and bees? Put
them in a journey!

#### Close your eyes (well, read this first and then close them)

#### and imagine yourself lying in your bed, looking around your

#### bedroom. At the foot of your bed there’s a giant, gnarled

#### tree with branches coming out in every direction. One of

#### those branches is sticking out above your head, and

#### dangling from it is a bright-green king cobra with red eyes

#### like lasers, razor-sharp fangs, and a forked tongue. It’s

#### staring right at you, but you don’t care. You get out of bed

#### and leave the room.

#### You head over to the bathroom, take a look inside, and

#### notice the sink, toilet, shower, and everything else are gone

#### —replaced by a red brick house with white shutters. The

#### windows are open, and bees are streaming out of there and

#### buzzing all around. They start to come after you, so you

#### dash to the living room.

#### You make it to the living room, but you can’t outrun the

#### bees. They’re stinging you everywhere. There might even

#### be a bee driving a Chevy Corvette Stingray through the wall,

#### if you can imagine that. But like the honey badger, you

#### don’t care.

#### You stroll over to the kitchen, and there’s that snake

#### again. This time, though, the snake is cowering in fear,

#### curled up in the corner. It’s stretching out its arms (this is

#### some crazy snake!) as if to push you away, and it’s

#### screaming, “Get away from me!”

Now, how could you ever forget those talking points?
Actually, that’s not a rhetorical question. You could forget
if you don’t **SEE–LINK–GO!** : Pay attention, visualize, find a
place to store it, add that magic **GO!** glue, and trust in your
memory. You could also lose your place as you’re up there
explaining at great length exactly how and why the honey
badger came to be so unfazed by a house full of bees. By
the time you’re ready for your next point, you may have to
jog your memory by retracing your journey from the
beginning, starting at your bed, moving into the bathroom,
and seeing the red brick house as your bookmark, then
going into the living room to get stung by bees and be
reminded that that’s the next item on your to-speak list. It’s
not the same as forgetting it entirely, but that little pause

#### might cost you some pronuntiatio points.

In terms of which journey to use, if time and space
permit, you can use the actual venue of the talk. Using the
venue is a bit less taxing on your brain—you don’t have to
visualize the space, since it’s right in front of you; all you
have to visualize are the images corresponding to your talk,
overlaid on the furniture and fixtures around you like a

#### cartoon layer, à la Who Framed Roger Rabbit.

### TO BE OR NOT TO BE... WHAT WAS THE

### QUESTION?

##### HOW TO REMEMBER POEMS

Sometimes memorizing the key talking points isn’t good
enough—you have to get each word exactly right. For
instance, in memory competitions we have to memorize
poems as precisely as possible—punctuation, capitalization,
and all. If you’re an actor, you have to do pretty much the
same thing (with even more contextual information such as
blocking) every time you get a new script. To do this, you
need a pretty long journey, even for fairly short texts,
because even if you chunk a few consecutive words
together you’ll still need at least one or two anchor points
per line of text. The general principle is the same as before,
but with word-for-word memorization you’ll need a code
similar to what we discussed in chapter 5 with regard to
passwords (see this page). Instead of finding something
concrete and visual for each of the characters on your
keyboard, you need something concrete and visual for all

#### the conjunctions (and, or, etc.), prepositions (to, in, at, etc.),

#### pronouns (he, she, etc.), and articles (a, the, etc.). You’ll also

need to represent punctuation and capitalization in your
code (if your recall requires you to write it down rather than
say it aloud). You can do this on the fly, though, since
consistency doesn’t matter as long as you can keep
everything straight. Sometimes the easiest way to encode
those short, abstract words is with a rhyme word that would
otherwise be out of place with the rest of the text—for

#### instance, replacing and with an image of sand, or a hand, or

a band (you can see a list of some of my go-to filler word
images in the appendix on this page).

To give you an example, I’ll break down the first stanza of
Shel Silverstein’s poem “One Inch Tall.” As always, you can
use any journey you like, but for the sake of illustrating this
with a slightly more iconic route (and to show you another
idea for what you can use as a journey), we’re going to take
a trip across the United States: starting in Miami and
moving up the East Coast to Washington, D.C., then to

Philadelphia, New York City, and Boston; heading west
toward Chicago, Denver, and San Francisco; and finally,
down to L.A. Each place has its own memorable scenery:
Miami Beach, the White House, the Liberty Bell, the Empire
State Building, Boston Harbor, the Sears Tower, the Rocky
Mountains, Lombard Street, and the Hollywood sign. Here
we go:

##### EXAMPLE—

#### IF YOU WERE ONLY ONE INCH TALL, YOU’D RIDE A

#### WORM TO SCHOOL.

#### THE TEARDROP OF A CRYING ANT WOULD BE YOUR

#### SWIMMING POOL.

#### A CRUMB OF CAKE WOULD BE A FEAST

#### AND LAST YOU SEVEN DAYS AT LEAST,

#### A FLEA WOULD BE A FRIGHTENING BEAST

#### IF YOU WERE ONE INCH TALL.

Before you start trying to store the stanza in the journey,

#### dive into it and imagine not just witnessing it but living it. As

you read the words, picture them playing out in your mind
and as you see them, try to feel the emotion of each line:
the freedom and pride of riding your very own worm to
school, the schadenfreude as the ant cries and you get to
swim around in its tears, the satisfaction of eating that
crumb, and the fear of that intimidating flea. After you’ve
read it once, read it again without storing it. On the second
pass, pay more attention to the structure of the lines, the
meter, and the rhyming scheme (if you want, on this second
pass try the First Letter Method from earlier in this section
[this page] so you can get an even better handle on the
stanza). Then, on the third pass, start coming up with
images for the exact words as you store them along your
journey.

## PRO TIP

**There is no right or wrong way to split up the lines.
It’s my personal preference to split them in half, but
it’s not always the case. If a line is short, I’ll just take
the entire line as one image. If a line is long, I might
even split it in three or four pieces. It all depends.
The important thing here is to be flexible and do
what feels reasonable to you.**

In this particular poem, the lines are a bit long, so we’re
going to split them in half. Here’s how I’d break them down:

#### “IF YOU WERE ONLY ONE INCH TALL,”

We’re standing in Miami on the beach (our first anchor
point) and we need to picture this phrase happening there.
This is an easy one, since it’s so concrete: Picture yourself
on the beach as if you were only one inch tall! That will give
you only the gist of the phrase, so you might add an image
for “if,” to get deeper into the specific wording. When I see
the word “if,” I imagine the Château d’If from the movie

#### version of The Count of Monte Cristo. So plop goes the

Château d’If on Miami Beach, and you’re only one inch tall
in comparison. To remember the word “only,” put emphasis

#### on the fact that you are the only person on the beach. One

thing to take note of is the point of view of the poem: It’s in

#### the second person. Everything is about you. It’s something

to keep in mind throughout the whole poem, not just in this
one line. What about the comma? This is where you need to
access your visual code for symbols. For instance, I
associate a comma with the action of falling, a period with
some type of bloody violence, and a semicolon with
mopping the floor. So to remember the comma at the end of
this phrase, I would picture my tiny one-inch self falling over
next to the Château d’If.

#### ... “YOU’D RIDE A WORM TO SCHOOL.”

Now you’re in D.C., in front of the White House, and you’re
riding a worm up to the White House, which looks like a
fancy school, with yellow school buses pulling up and
students milling around carrying backpacks. What about the
period at the end? According to my code, I need some
bloody violence in there, so maybe a sniper takes me out as
I approach the front door of the White House.

#### “THE TEARDROP OF A CRYING ANT”

This one is also easy to picture, and memorable too.
Imagine there’s a giant ant atop the Liberty Bell, and it’s
crying hysterically as a massive teardrop runs down the bell.

#### Pretty simple, but if you’re worried about confusing crying

#### with a stronger verb like sobbing, add something small and

similar-sounding, like a crayon, to remind you.

#### “WOULD BE YOUR SWIMMING POOL.”

We’re in New York City now, so picture a wooden bee in a
swimming pool on the top of the Empire State Building. Why

#### a wooden bee? To help you remember would be. It’s not

about representing each word perfectly but about

#### representing all the words in some fashion (except your,

which comes up over and over enough to be inferred
wherever it appears). Plus, it’s weird and random—which
means it’s memorable.

#### “A CRUMB OF CAKE WOULD BE A FEAST”

Sometimes you can fit a whole line into one image. This
particular line happens to be short and simple, so you can
imagine Boston Harbor (or any colonial-looking harbor) with
a giant, floating cake in the water, and a single crumb flakes
off and is promptly feasted upon by that same wooden bee.

#### If the word feast trips you up as something that’s hard to

#### picture, maybe instead, imagine the bee holding a fist (fist

#### is close enough to feast) in the air like a rock star as it eats

the crumb.

#### “AND LAST YOU SEVEN DAYS AT LEAST,”

Now at the Sears Tower, we have an abstract—and therefore
difficult—line to imagine word for word. Let’s split it in half.

#### “AND LAST YOU”

#### For prepositions like and and or you’ll want to use

#### contrasting preset images. For me, and is a circle and or is a

square. So I might picture myself at the Sears Tower
standing on a circular platform; I’m last in line to get into
the building, and lit up on the side of the building is the logo
from my alma mater, the University of Miami, aka The U

#### (pronounced like you).

#### “SEVEN DAYS AT LEAST,”

On a mountain in Denver, imagine that you’re throwing a
boomerang (the number seven) while singing “Day-O,” then
falling down the mountain (because the comma is marked
by the falling motion).

#### “A FLEA WOULD BE A FRIGHTENING BEAST”

On Lombard Street, Flea (the bassist from the Red Hot Chili
Peppers) is being stung by that wooden bee, and he’s
screaming over and over, “A frightening beast!!!” as he runs
down the famous winding road.

#### “IF YOU WERE ONE INCH TALL.”

Lastly, you’re at the Hollywood sign in L.A. Since this line is

#### the same as the first, minus the word only, you’re going to

picture the exact same thing as you stand under the sign—

#### except you’re not the only person there. Don’t forget

something gory for the period!

That’s everything! Now try, without looking back, to see
if you remember all the images (they don’t have to be
exact, just roughly what was happening at each anchor
point). Some may have been easier to remember word-
forword; others may be off a bit, but at least you can recall
the images. Don’t worry, you can go through it again if you
must. The crucial part for me, after I’ve done the encoding
of words to images, is to write down what I remember the
first time I retrace my journey. I find that writing it down at
this point adds another dimension of visualization that helps
with recall, since there are so many tiny details. As I write it
down from memory, I’ll keep the poem next to me if I
stumble anywhere and need a crutch to remind me, but I try
not to look at it at all. Once I’ve written it down once or
twice, the poem is cemented into my mind.

Everyone is different, so experiment a bit to see what
works best for you: memorizing smaller or larger pieces,
memorizing key words here and there, mixing it with a bit of
rote repetition, whatever!
However, note that once you’ve memorized a set speech
or poem, making it verbally fluid isn’t always a given.
Remember, these techniques get information into your
memory fast but don’t necessarily make you quick on the
draw, so to speak... at least not at first. Once you have it
in your brain, though, you can then review it as often as you
want, anywhere you are by just accessing your journey.¶ If

#### you want your pronuntiatio to be seamless, you’ll have to

#### practice not just memoria but the whole quintet of rhetoric

all at once. This is something that just takes repetition. As
you continue to perform your speech or poem aloud, it will
eventually become a single fluid thought, like a song you’ve
sung a thousand times—and in the event that you stumble,
you’ll always have the basic rubric in your mind to get you
back on track without too much hesitation.

## SECTION 2 — LANGUAGE

Words, words, words; they’re in everything that we say,
write, and hear. There is always the need to learn new
words, new concepts, new languages. In the previous
section we used **SEE–LINK–GO!** to make sure we memorize
every single word and punctuation mark of a text perfectly,
and we can follow the same process to help us increase our
vocabulary in our native tongue or even in a foreign one.

### WHERE’S THE DICTIONARY?

##### HOW TO REMEMBER VOCABULARY WORDS AND THEIR

##### MEANINGS

Let’s start with learning new words in your native language.
How does one go about memorizing new words and
definitions? Well, it’s a lot like names and faces. We see a
word and we see a definition (like a face and a name), so we
come up with an image for both and then we **LINK** them
together. You remember that process, right? With words and
definitions, it’s a bit easier because we don’t have to search
for a distinguishing feature on a face (which can sometimes
be a bit tricky). Imagine that learning a new vocab word is
like an equation. The left-hand side is the word in question,
while the right-hand side of the equation is the short (or
long) definition. Coming up with an image for the left-hand
side is something we know very well. We learned it early on
in this book (this is just the **SEE** step). The right-hand side is
where our newly honed text-memorizing skills come in
handy. You won’t need to memorize word for word, but
maybe a few words to get a good sense of what the
definition means. Sounds like we’re aiming for that “good
enough” target, right? The idea is that you take a few key
words in the definition and come up with an image for that
chunk. Once you have that chunk, you link it with the image

you had for the left side. Then, the next time you hear the
word or you hear some type of definition, you can
remember the opposite side of the equation based on that
anchor point being served to you. It’s actually better
reinforced than the names and faces technique because you
have doubly linked anchors. Give me the left side and I can
recall the right. Give me the right and I can recall the left.

### LET’S TRY A FEW TOGETHER

#### EXAMPLE 1—Garderobe = a medieval toilet; a privy. \*\*

#### Garderobe reminds me of a garter (you know, those sexy

things you might find on your wife-to-be’s leg?) and a robe.
So I would imagine a voluptuously sexy woman in a robe
with only a garter on underneath. Now for the right-hand
side of the equation: a medieval toilet. Well, that’s
memorable in itself, isn’t it? I’m going to imagine a filthy old
toilet from medieval times. Now we **LINK** and **GO!** This one
is so simple to make memorable: Imagine that gorgeous
voluptuous woman in a garter and robe sitting herself on
that disgusting toilet and making it a real mess. I’ll let you
add as much color to that one as you’d like!

#### EXAMPLE 2—Vainglorious = having or showing too

**much pride in your abilities or achievements.**

I love this word because it sounds exactly like what it is. But
let’s say you couldn’t make an educated guess about what it
means. You might picture someone with a big, blood-
pumping vein on his or her forehead. It’s so big that it’s
absolutely glorious! On the right-hand side, our definition is
a tad long, but I’m going to latch onto “showing too much

#### pride.” To me, the word pride is too abstract, so I’ll imagine

a more tangible sense of that word: a pride of lions. Here’s
my **GO!** image: This person with the massive, throbbing
vein that’s glorious is showing it too much to this pride of

lions. Those lions are absolutely bloodthirsty and are about
to attack that juicy (gloriously juicy) vein at a moment’s
notice!

#### EXAMPLE 3—Fratricide = the crime of murdering your

**own brother or sister.**

This word reminds me of a college frat house serving up a
lot of under-age kids with some alcoholic cide-r. The right-
hand side makes me picture my brother or sister being
murdered (not pleasant, unfortunately). When we **GO!** , we
might get an image of this cider-serving frat house
welcoming in all brothers and sisters. Sadly, all the cider is
poisoned, and the frat house is essentially a place where all
brothers and sisters are going to get murdered. This is a
very dark image, but hey, sometimes you need something
like that to make it stick out.

This technique makes learning new vocabulary a breeze.
For those in need of memorizing a book full of SAT or GRE
words, you can get it done in one or two sittings. The key
thing that makes it so quick and easy is that you don’t need
to memorize the definitions word for word—you just need
the bare minimum to recognize them (if you do want to
memorize the definition word for word, you’ll have to think
back on our poem-memorizing approach from a few pages
ago [this page]—totally doable, but a little more
challenging).

### QU’EST-CE QUE C’EST?

##### HOW TO REMEMBER FOREIGN WORDS AND THEIR

##### MEANINGS

What about foreign-language words? In my opinion, they’re
easier to memorize because the left-hand side (the foreign
word) is almost meaningless to you upon first glance. This
allows you to have full freedom and flexibility to go crazy
with your imagination. Since you have no fixed notion of
what that word might mean or look like, you can make it as

#### far-fetched as you want (in fact, you have to do this for

exactly that reason). Since French is my native language
(my parents are French-Belgian, in case you didn’t know),
why not let me teach you a few of the language’s most
beautiful words?

### LET’S TRY A FEW TOGETHER

#### EXAMPLE 1—Chou = cabbage

#### Chou (pronounced like “shoe”) is a funny little word I grew

up with because my parents would use it with each other as

#### a term of endearment. Calling each other cabbage isn’t

particularly endearing, I agree, but in French it just sounds

#### so sweet! Because the word sounds like “shoe” and means

“cabbage,” if we **LINK** the two sides of the equation, we get
a memorable image of a shoe stomping the hell out of a

#### cabbage. STOMP STOMP STOMP! Not so sweet after all, is it?

Memorable though!††

#### EXAMPLE 2—Baleine = whale

Something about this word just feels so elegant and light
and fluffy to me. It’s a beautiful word. Which makes it even

#### more striking when you realize it means whale, something

#### so massive and funny looking. Baleine (pronounced “bah-

lenn”) kinda-sorta sounds like “balloon.” (with a few
liberties, sure, but remember we don’t necessarily need a

#### perfect-sounding word. It just needs to be close enough to

get us the image.). **LINK** ing it with the definition of a whale,
we can imagine a balloon being filled with air inside of a
whale, causing it to grow and grow into the massive
mammal it is! Maybe it even fills up with so much air that it
floats up into the sky just like a balloon. Weird, but
memorable.

#### EXAMPLE 3—Tournesol = sunflower

#### Tournesol translates literally as “turned toward the sun.” If

you’ve ever watched a field of sunflowers, they actually turn
their faces with the movement of the sun. It’s amazing to

#### see. Tournesol (pronounced “tour-nuh-suhl”) reminds me of

#### a tournament of soul. I would imagine a sort of Soul Train TV

show where there is a Tournament of Soul happening. What
does the winner of this epic dance-off get? A sunflower, of
course!

#### EXAMPLE 4—Pamplemousse = grapefruit

This is a funny one. Pronounced “pump-le-moose,” it sounds

#### like pumping a moose, so I would picture me pumping up a

moose (using some kind of large tire pump) with grapefruits.
Actual grapefruits are being pumped into the body of the
moose. What?! Yup. It’s as simple as that.

#### EXAMPLE 5—Vachement = very; truly

I absolutely love this word. It’s so silly but so expressive at
the same time. And if you listen carefully to French
speakers, you’ll hear it sprinkled throughout casual
conversations everywhere you go. It translates literally as
“cowly” or “like a cow” but is used as an adjective to give

#### something more emphasis (e.g., vachement bien means

#### “amazingly good”). Vachement (pronounced “vash-mon”)

#### sounds like rash-man (said with a Jamaican accent: rash-

#### mon). I know rash and vash don’t start with the same letter,

but that’s okay, it’s close enough. This should be a quick

#### association of a rash-mon, some Jamaican guy who is

covered in a rash. **LINK** ing it to the other side of the

#### equation, we can just emphasize his VERY intense rash; it

#### TRULY is the worst rash you’ve ever seen. He is vachement

#### a rash-mon.

With this skill, you could power through some serious
quantities of foreign vocabulary in a very short amount of
time. Will you become fluent this way? Definitely not.

#### Learning a language takes many hours of using the

language, not just memorizing.

That said, to master a language you do need to know a
good chunk of words—and if you can memorize the first few
thousand most-common words in your target language,
you’ll be well ahead of the game. In French, learning just the
first two thousand most common words will allow you to
read and understand about 80 percent of books!
While the previous tips for memorizing meanings will
take you far, you’ll need to spice up your approach and get
a little more creative when adding more complex linguistic
details. For example, if you need to remember whether a
word is feminine or masculine (or neuter, in some
languages), you can simply place your images in a specific
location. It doesn’t have to be on a specific path, just in a
general area. For example, maybe all your female-gendered

#### foods (fraise/strawberry and framboise/raspberry) get

placed inside the barn at a farm you knew when you were
growing up. Maybe all the male-gendered foods

#### (chou/cabbage and pamplemousse/grapefruit) get placed

#### outside the barn. Or maybe you use two houses to enclose

all of your learned French words—one house for masculine
words, the other for feminine words. So you could place all
the words for kitchen utensils in the kitchens of both homes,
only one would be for masculine words, the other for
feminine.

## SECTION 3 — A MISHMASH OF THINGS

I would need whole volumes of books to cover every single
memory strategy known to man, but unfortunately we have
to end things at some point or another. We’ve already

covered a lot of ground, but before we move on to the last
chapter, where I’ll be giving you some general brain-health
tips, let me rapid-fire some other examples of how you can
utilize everything you’ve learned so far to memorize useful
things.

### PARIS, UH... SPAIN?

##### HOW TO REMEMBER COUNTRIES AND CAPITALS

To remember countries and their capitals is no different from
learning a word and its definition... well, except that it’s
even easier since the “definition” is just another word—the
capital—not an entire sentence. You could honestly learn all
195 country capitals in a very short amount of time if you
wanted to.

**EXAMPLE 1—Afghanistan-Kabul**

#### An Afghan dog (you know, those tall, pointy-nosed, long-

#### haired dogs?) exploding KABOOMand turning into a bull

(KABOOM-bull = Kabul).

**EXAMPLE 2—Montenegro-Podgorica**

#### A mountain growing (Montenegro) out of a string bean pod

#### with all of its guts and gore pouring out (pod-gore =

Podgorica).

**EXAMPLE 3—Estonia-Tallinn**

#### Imagine a stone (Estonia) being thrown at a very tall giant

(Tallinn).

**EXAMPLE 4—Iceland-Reykjavik**

#### Imagine ice cubes (Iceland) melting on top of a rake that’s

#### raking up a floor covered in Vic’s cough medicine lozenges

(rake-vic = Reykjavik).

**EXAMPLE 5—Honduras-Tegucigalpa**

#### A foreign, non-English-speaking Uber driver driving a Honda

#### (Honduras) Civic asking if he can take you to see a pond

filled with kelp fish (take-you-see-kelp = Tegucigalpa).

### WHEN WAS THE BATTLE OF HASTINGS?

##### HOW TO REMEMBER HISTORIC DATES

To memorize historic dates, we basically need to memorize
a definition (left-hand, right-hand equation) except with a
number (either a year or a year and a date) on the left-hand
side of our equation. Since we are well equipped with some
buttery-smooth number strategies, we can memorize

#### anything that has a number attached.

**EXAMPLE 1—1066: Battle of Hastings**

The famous battle that started the Norman conquest of
Britain, and one of those dates that every British kid needs
to learn in middle school. We can use the Major System to

#### come up with an image for 1066. How about eats-judge (10–

#### 66)? Eating a judge super quickly, or rather, hastily! NOM,

#### NOM, NOM! And if you want to add some more information,

such as that the Norman forces were led by William the
Conqueror, why not picture William Shatner conquering a

#### judge on a battlefield and then eating him! William Shatner

#### conquering—eats-judge. Let’s go further and add the full

date: October 14. We learned a few ways to add dates in
chapter 5 (see this page), but let’s imagine October as a
color (I think of orange, because PUMPKINS!), and 14, using

#### the Major System, could be a tear—an orange tear. Mixing it

in with what we’ve already got, that judge, while being

#### eaten, is crying orange tears.

**EXAMPLE 2—November 6, 1860: Abraham Lincoln is
elected.**

#### The year 1863 can be encoded into tough-shoes (18-33).

Picture a really tough, sturdy pair of shoes being thrown at
President Lincoln as he wins the election, taking the stage
for his victory speech. To add November 6, I’ll use a color for
November (maybe brown since it’s a fall-ish color) and then
a golf club to represent 6 (Number-Shape System, this

#### page). I’m whacking tough-shoes with my brown golf club at

#### President Lincoln giving his election victory speech. Nice.

Here’s another useful strategy for **SEE** ing four-digit
years. Choose a real or fictional location to represent the
centuries. The 1800s could be a saloon in the Wild Wild
West. The 1100s could be a medieval castle. The 1900s
could be the Eiffel Tower. Whatever comes to mind when
you think of a century, find a related location. Then, when
you have a date you need to memorize, just dump all the
images in the same location. Make sure to keep your
locations relatively large and open so you have plenty of
room to add new content. Let’s try a few rapid-fire, made-up
dates and events to show you what I mean:

##### EXAMPLE 3—

#### 1845: ALIENS DANCE ON EARTH

#### 1906: QUEEN IS DECAPITATED

#### 2011: FLYING CAR INVENTED

I’ll make the 1800s a saloon, the 1900s the Eiffel Tower, and
the 2000s outer space (since it sounds futuristic and all). For
this example, I’ll use my PAO for the two-digit year.

## PRO TIP

**If I had multiple dates in the same century, there
wouldn’t be a problem storing them all in the same
location. Remember, I stressed that the locations
should be open and large so that there is room for
everyone.**

### WHAT DAY OF THE WEEK WERE YOU BORN?

##### HOW TO REMEMBER THE CALENDAR

A neat little trick to remember what day of the week any
date will fall on in this year (2018), last year (2017), or next
year (2019) is something called the Doomsday Calculation.
It’s actually not much memory at all. All you need to
memorize are the following lists:

#### 2016 0

#### 2017 1

#### 2018 2

#### 2019 3

#### 2020 5

For the month, remember this list (I’ve included a quick
mnemonic to help you):

#### January 5 Imagine 5 inches of snow in

#### winter

#### February 1 The 1 month that has the

#### fewest days

#### March 1 1 man marching

#### April 4 Aprrrrrrril has an “R,” so does

#### fourrrrrrr

#### May 6 May(be) if you’re lucky, you’ll

#### have sex (six)

#### June 2 June is way 2 hot

#### July 4 July 4, Independence Day!

#### August 0 Think of a gust of wind

#### blowing through an oval-

#### shape hole

#### September 3 Start of the school year, 3-

#### year-olds going to preschool

#### October 5 Think of 5 scary ghosts for

#### Halloween

#### November 1 1 st cold month of winter

#### December 3 3 kings for Christmas

```
And finally, one easy list for the days of the week:
```

#### Sunday 0 or 7

#### Monday 1

#### Tuesday 2

#### Wednesday 3

#### Thursday 4

#### Friday 5

#### Saturday 6

Okay, check it out. You’re going to have to do a tiny bit of
math here. (I know, I know! This is a memory book, not a
math book! Just a little math, okay? The payout is
awesome!) Every addition we do, whenever we spill over 7,
we go back down to zero (and in our weird world of math, 7
is synonymous with 0). For example, say I have the number
2 and I add 2, that’s 4. Duh. But say I have 4 + 4, that would
typically be 8, but that spills over 7 by 1, so my answer is 1.
If we start on a bigger number like 28, just divide by 7 and
keep the remainder—that’s essentially what we’re doing
here. So say we have 28 + 4. I take that god-awful large

number of 28 (we don’t like doing math with large numbers,
right?) and divide it by 7 and keep the remainder: 0. Now
it’s just 0+4, that’s 4.

```
The calendar date calculation goes as follows:
```

```
* Take the number code for the year
* Take the number code for the month
* Take the number of the day
* Add them together (making sure to always
divide by 7 and keep the remainder)
* Translate your answer, which will be a number
between 0 and 6, into a day of the week:
Sunday to Saturday.
```

**EXAMPLE 1—February 4, 2017**

```
* 2017 is 1
* February is a 1
* 4 th is a 4
* That’s 1+1+4 = 6
* 6 is a Saturday. February 4, 2017 was a
Saturday.
```

**EXAMPLE 2—December 25, 2019**

```
* 2019 is 3
* December is a 3
* 25 th is 25, but dividing by 7 and taking the
remainder is 3 R 4, so 4.
* That’s 3+3+4 = 10. Again, divide by 7 and take
the remainder, that’s 3. Christmas Day in
2019 is a Wednesday.
```

Pretty sweet, right? Now for the next few years you won’t
ever have to check a calendar, you’ll know almost instantly
what day of the week a certain date falls on.

## PRO TIP

**One small detail you’ll have to keep in mind are leap
years (a year where there is one extra day in the
calendar year). Both 2016 and 2020 are leap years.
For those cases, you need to subtract 1 ONLY IF your
month is February or March.**

#### Now what if you want to do any year in history? There is

a way to do this, but it requires a little more memorization
and math. See my website,

### ACE OF HEARTS, KING OF DIAMONDS...

##### HOW TO REMEMBER A DECK OF CARDS

When you first picked up this book, I bet you were downright
itching to get past all the incredibly practical, everyday
memory techniques so you could get to the really fun and
mostly useless little tricks at the end. Well, I decided to save
the best for last: It’s time to learn how to memorize a deck
of cards!
It’s not as useless as you think, though. While it may not
save you any grief at a meeting or on a test—and it won’t
be of much use at the blackjack table, unless you can find a
casino that pays out for simply remembering the exact

#### order of cards that have already been dealt— the ability to

#### memorize a deck of cards is one of the best ways to

#### practice, measure, and improve your mnemonic

#### abilities. Plus, once you get the hang of it and get fast

enough to not bore people to death while they wait for you

to memorize, it’s actually a pretty impressive feat to show
off at parties. As you improve, you’ll find that you’re not
only more confident in your memory but also better at
tuning out distractions in other areas of your life. And it’s
incredibly easy to train; you just need a deck of cards and
your mind.

Now, I never said memorizing a deck of cards was easy.
Some people think it should be, since memory is all about
visualization and cards are visual objects with different sorts
of distinguishing marks. Unfortunately, all those marks are
actually multiple layers of abstract information, hard to
distinguish from one another—especially when you’re
staring at fifty-two of them. Try to start with just five cards,
with no technique, and see if you can remember that many
(in order):

Spend about twenty seconds staring at those cards, then
do something else to take your mind off them momentarily.
Go check your email. Have a daydream about kittens flying
World War I–era biplanes, wearing leather helmets and
goggles. Do whatever it takes to get those cards out of your
working memory, to see if you’ve got them stored more
securely.
Annnnnd... welcome back. Don’t look at the cards yet!

#### Do you remember them perfectly? Okay, now you can look

at them to see if you remembered them. How’d you do?

Think you can multiply that challenge by ten (or 10.4, to be
exact)? I know you can, but as always, you need a system.
Go grab a deck of cards, and get ready to dive in.

### PAO, AGAIN

Awwwwww yeah—your most favorite chunking method ever
is back with a vengeance and it’s... pretty much the same
as it was when you created your two-digit number system
(see this page). In fact, you can even repurpose some of
your people from your number system, because the first
letters of all four card suits—H, C, D, and S—are also letters
in the PAO System. For instance, if your person for the
number 68 is Stephen Hawking (S.H.), you can also use him
for the 6 of hearts (H = 8); if Nicolas Cage is 93 (N.C.), he
can also be the 9 of clubs (C = 3). There are other ways to
assign people to the numbered cards (ace through 10), but
let’s skip them for now and focus first on face cards.
Got your deck handy? I want you to go through it and pull
out the twelve face cards—just the kings, queens, and jacks.
Before you try to implement a system, I want you to simply
look at each card and see if you can come up with an
intuitive association for it. You may not have an immediate
association with every one, and that’s okay. Only a few
jumped out at me: The king of clubs was Tiger Woods (since
he’s the king of swinging a golf club); the king and queen of
hearts were my dad and mom, whom I love with all my
heart. You want to start with these because you’re already
“fluent” in their code—which is to say, you don’t have to
look up at the ceiling and think, “Okay, the king is a K, and
the hearts are an H, so that’s KH, and the person with
initials KH is.. .” No, with these you should be able to think
of the relevant person as soon as you see the card.

Once you’ve made all the immediate associations you
can (which shouldn’t take long, of course), you need to
consider who you want to represent each of the remaining

cards. You can use the PAO System if you’d like—though you
may not come up with too many first names starting with Q,
so you’re better off using something like M or R for the
Queens. However, you may come up with better
associations if you think of each suit as its own category.
The king and queen are then the top man and woman within
that category, and the jack is a younger or secondary figure.
Here’s one way to do it:

Your categories don’t have to be the same as mine. They
can be anything you know well and can distinguish as
distinct individuals with distinct actions and objects. Maybe
you don’t know sports well enough to come up with a few
specific athletes you can visualize; maybe Greek mythology
is more your thing. So pick out a suit (maybe spades, since

the spade somewhat resembles a mountain, i.e., Olympus)
and make Zeus a king, Hera a queen, and Apollo a jack.
Once you’ve assigned people to the face cards, you’ll need
actions and objects for them. We know this process all too
well from chapter 5 (this page), so flip back to that part if
you need a refresher.

Now, with those twelve cards in hand, I want you to go
through them, one by one, and really try to visualize the
people performing their actions with their objects. Make
sure you really know them before trying to memorize them.
After you get the hang of recognizing and visualizing the
cards’ images, pick out a small journey to practice—you
need only four anchor points since you’ll be storing three
cards as one image: person-action-object. Shuffle the cards
and lay the first three in front of you, then visualize the first
card’s person performing the second card’s action with the
third card’s object in the first anchor point, and so on.
Here’s a random ordered set of those twelve face cards
and what I would imagine upon seeing them (I’ll place them
in an apartment of someone I know and use my PAO system
on this page):

##### EXAMPLE—

##### QS—JS—KH—KD—JD—JC—KS—QC—QH—JH—QD—KC

**1 QS—JS—KH** (Jennifer Connelly—moonwalking—on a piece
of paper.) I’ll place this bizarre image on the bed. There’s
Jenny ruffling up all the sheets as she strangely attempts
to moonwalk backward on top of a sheet of paper.

**2 KD—JD—JC** (James Bond—crushing—a sandwich.) This
image goes on the nightstand. A miniature version of
James Bond is holding an oversize sandwich in his hands
and crushing it until it splatters all over the nightstand
and his face.

**3 KS—QC—QH** (A rabbi—dancing—with a frying pan.)
There’s a full-length mirror next to the nightstand. I’m
going to imagine a rabbi looking at himself in the mirror
as he dances a heavy salsa routine while clutching a
frying pan close to his chest quite passionately as if it’s
his dance partner.

**4 JH—QD—KC** (Jack Sparrow—shopping—for a golf club.)
The final image will go in the closet. We see Jack Sparrow
prancing around the closet space with big Bloomingdale’s
shopping bags in his hands as he stuffs all sorts of golf
clubs into them (they don’t really fit, but whatever!).

That’s it! Your images probably won’t resemble mine, but
now you know exactly the process that goes through my
head as I attempt to memorize a deck of cards.‡‡
Once you’re comfortable with your face cards, you’re
ready to bring in the rest of the deck. If you like your
number system and can incorporate the appropriately
initialed people with the corresponding cards (Aces
representing 1s, and 10s representing 0s), that may be your
quickest way to compile a card system. If you need some
extra help, have a peek in the appendix on this page to see
my full PAO card system.

As you practice, if any particular cards give you trouble,
you can swap in new people using your suit categories. For
me, the 4 of hearts was hard to remember as David
Hasselhoff (D.H.), so I thought about a D name that would fit
the loved ones category (loved ones = Hearts). Ultimately, I
pictured my old dog (D for dog; the 4 also corresponds to a
dog’s four legs), and that turned out to be way more
memorable for me.
After studying the number cards by visualizing them one
by one, the same way you did with the face cards, try
splitting a deck in half and storing those cards along a nine-

anchor-point journey (since 9 times 3 is 27 but you’ll be
using only 26 cards, the last image will be just person-action
with no object). Take as much time as you need to get those
images in there, but keep track of your time with a timer. If
it takes you half an hour, that’s okay; just make note of the
time so you can try to beat it later. The slower you go at
first, the easier it’ll be to beat!

Try to get everything stored in one pass—no peeking at
the last card or starting over from the beginning—and then
take a second pass to see if you can remember the cards
one at a time. Start by recalling the first one before you flip
it over, then connect that with your mental image at the
first anchor point to remind you of the second and third
cards. If you get stuck at any point where you know the next
card is a person or action but can’t place it, flip that card
over and see if it reminds you of the action or object card
that follows. Once you can get through a full pass like that
without errors, try to memorize in one pass and then recall
by writing out the order, then checking it against the cards
to see how you did. Time yourself on the memorization and
recall portions separately, and log your times to see how
you improve day by day.
One of the biggest struggles when starting out is
quashing the temptation to look back at the cards you’ve
already seen. There will be an internal struggle as you
memorize, where your mind will be saying, “You need to
look back at the previous cards again—you DON’T have
them memorized!” But you do! Don’t go back. TRUST your
memory. You’ll make bigger gains by resisting that urge, I
promise.

#### The root of all health is in the brain. The trunk of it is in

#### emotion. The branches and leaves are the body. The flower

#### of health blooms when all parts work together.

##### —KURDISH SAYING

Up until now I’ve covered pretty much every little thing you
could ever possibly need to improve your memorization
skills. I’ve shown you how to attack almost any type of
information, using one of my strategies or by comfortably
figuring out your own. I’ve provided tons of examples and
some guidance to help you master the techniques, which
you may have noticed aren’t incredibly difficult. Hopefully,
you feel that you’ve awakened the memory power that was
always in you, lying dormant until you picked up this book.
But besides the techniques and strategies to memorize all
the things you could potentially come in contact with in your
daily life, there are some other tips, let’s call them...
intangibles, that if incorporated into your daily regimen will
help you have not only a better memory, but a healthier

#### brain as well. Remember that when I started on this journey

to improve my memory, it wasn’t just so I could impress my
friends by memorizing a deck of cards, nor was it so I could
remember the names of everyone I met. It was so that I
would be able to keep a strong and healthy mind for as long

as I live; so that what happened to my grandmother would
never happen to me.

Enter your personal memory coach, Nelson Dellis (me!
hello!). Everything up until this point has been “How do I
memorize this?” and “How do I memorize that?”—but not so
much “How do I get better at memorizing once I already
know how to memorize this and that?” or “What are other
things I can do to improve my memory that don’t involve
actual memorizing?” Obviously, the first thing you should
have been doing as you learned the techniques throughout
the book is put them into practice in your life. If you’re
about to meet a ton of people, use the techniques we
discussed in chapter 3 (see this page); if you’re in need of
holding on to that login password for your email account,
refer to our strategies in chapter 5 (see this page); if you’re
pressed for time and have a speech to deliver the next
morning or if you’re in need of a memory boost as you study
for your SATs, implement the techniques you learned in
chapter 6 (see this page). I hope you noticed that I’ve tried
to make all the examples in this book come close to the
real-life situations you might find yourself in, so that the
memory tips are as practical as possible. With that in mind,
you should find that it’s easy to incorporate everything
you’ve learned so far to enhance your daily life.
That being said, this last chapter will serve as an offering
of some last few tips to make sure your memory stays in tip-
top shape and that your brain stays healthy. (Also, for those
interested in taking their memory training to the next level
and for those not satisfied with using just everyday
situations as practice, I suggest some ideas for daily training
and some tools to help train in the appendix on this page.)

Incorporating everything you’ve learned so far in this
book to enhance your daily life is all well and good, but how
do you keep your brain strong and healthy? What can I do

#### now to help my aged brain, decades from now? These were

the main driving questions I had when I first began this
quest to improve my memory. I didn’t want to end up
suffering from Alzheimer’s disease when I got older, as my
grandmother did, so I thought if I kept my brain healthy and
fit, I might prolong its lifespan.\*

Over the years of my memory studies and training, I’ve
come up with four key pillars of brain health that I try to live
by on a daily basis that I recommend you try as well. These
are things I personally believe will improve your cognitive
sharpness and the longevity of your brain:

I know what you’re thinking. “Diet? Exercise? Really,
Nelson? I just bought this book to work on my memory, not
my body!” Don’t fret: I’m not going to ask you to stop eating
pizza or do intense interval training every day. All I’m going
to propose are a few tips and suggestions—simple things
you can incorporate into your lifestyle. All have sound
science behind them, and I’ve seen firsthand (by
meticulously analyzing my memory training scores and

data) just how much of a difference even a small amount of
these changes can make.

So are you in? You already have the tools. Now you just
need the right oil, fuel, and nuts and bolts to make your
brain the complete package.

### I THINK, THEREFORE I AM... WHAT I EAT

##### TIPS FOR IMPROVING MEMORY BY EATING RIGHT†

As a general rule of thumb, whatever is good for your body
is good for your brain. There are, however, a few things to
eat that may boost your memory, and a few things to avoid
that may hamper it.
The most convincing evidence so far is the “Memory
Improvement with Docosahexaenoic Acid Study,”^1 also
known as the MIDAS study, in which subjects aged fifty-five
and older with mild memory complaints were given a daily
dose of supplemental Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA), an
omega-3 fatty acid that’s an important structural
component of the brain and is often extracted from fish oil
as a nutritional supplement. When taken over six months,
DHA was correlated with statistically significant
improvements in cognitive function, including memory and
learning. The subjects took 900 mg of algal DHA daily, in the
form of a capsule. This is also what I recommend and have
been taking for years, mainly because of this particular
study and also because of the results I’ve noticed while
taking that dosage versus not taking anything at all. Most
people are familiar with taking fish oil pills, and hey, you
may even be taking some already, but check that you’re
getting around 900 mg of DHA. EPA and ALA are two other
omega-3 fatty acids that are commonly found in
supplements, but be aware that these fatty acids eventually
convert to DHA and it takes a lot of each to equal a very
small amount of DHA. So in short, make sure you’re going

straight for the good stuff and getting that DHA omega-3
specifically.

Other studies have shown that berries, or other foods
that are high in antioxidants (pecans, artichoke, and kidney
beans, to name just a few), can help fight the high
susceptibility of the brain to oxidative damage.^2
While there are definitely some proven mental health
benefits to eating certain foods, when all is said and done,
eating well and avoiding the bad stuff—a healthy diet—will
do wonders for your mental clarity.

## PRO TIP

**I often get the question, should I just eat more fish?
Always check with your doctor or a dietitian, but my
answer to that is no. There have been shown to be
health issues related to too much fish consumption,
so stick with a supplement. You’ll get more DHA that
way anyway. And if you want to avoid the fish-oil-pill
fish burps, try taking algal DHA (i.e., DHA capsules
that are in algae form). The algae is the stuff that
has the DHA, not the fish. The fish eats the algae,
which is why fish oil also has DHA. Make sense?**

I have a sweet tooth and love to eat high-carb foods like
bread and pasta, but I limit them as best I can and often
adhere to diets that completely eliminate some of those
foods for long periods. (Some favorite go-to diets of mine
are the Ketogenic Diet, the Paleo Diet, and the Whole30
diet^3 —basically all modified versions of the Atkins Diet,
which focuses on eating only whole, natural foods; that
means no dairy, processed foods, sugars, or alcohol, and
low to zero carbs.) Sticking to a strict diet can be difficult, I
know, but there is no denying the benefits that can follow,
ranging from improvement in focus to heightened mental

acuity, to of course a better memory. In fact, recent studies
have shown that the Ketogenic Diet (low-carb, high-fat) can
do absolute wonders for your brain by reducing
inflammation, sharpening cognition, and eliminating that all-
too-common brain fog.^4 Oh, and as for those ginkgo biloba
supplements that you’ve probably heard about that are
supposedly brain-friendly? Not only are they ineffective, a
recent toxicology study showed that ginkgo biloba actually

#### caused cancer in lab rats.^5 If you want that quick fix for

#### improved memory without the training and

#### techniques, look into changing your diet —you’ll be

amazed at the results from such a simple change.

### I’M TIRED AND I CAN’T REMEMBER ANYTHING!

##### TIPS FOR IMPROVING MEMORY BY SLEEPING RIGHT

Diet is great for your brain, but the most important thing

#### you should be feeding your brain is sleep. A good night’s

#### sleep helps you better form memories the next day,

#### and it also helps you hang on to the things you

#### learned the day before. Pulling an all-nighter could lower

your memory performance by up to 40 percent.^6
Sleeplessness also seems to make our memories more
susceptible to interference,^7 which means more confusion
and less confidence in our minds. I always aim to get at
least seven hours of sleep, as many nights of the week as I
can. Of course, things come up: I have a late night with my
friends, or I’m traveling on long flights, working long hours

#### (basically, life), but it’s all about balance. Try to make up for

that sleep somewhere else in the day with a well-placed
power nap. Or instead of Netflix-binging your favorite
television series in one night until you’re bleeding from your
eyes, hang up your cleats and get to bed earlier than usual.
Your body and mind will thank you not only in the short term
but in the long term as well.

### NO PAIN, NO GAIN, SLIGHTLY MORE BRAIN

##### TIPS FOR IMPROVING MEMORY BY STAYING ACTIVE

##### AND EXERCISING

After many conclusive studies on exercise and memory, at
this point it’s practically a fact that exercise benefits your

#### brain. Aerobic exercise has been demonstrated to

#### increase the size of the hippocampus, which is one of

the primary brain regions for memory.^8 It also improves
spatial memory^9 and cognitive function,^10 and some studies
on rats have shown that exercise during pregnancy
improves the offspring’s memory, even as an adult.^11 It’s
also a given that when you exercise, you generally feel
better about yourself. You feel healthy, you look better,
blood flow to the brain is improved (since your brain is a
highly vascular organ), and your body runs better
altogether. You will feel sharper and more on your game just
because you were active. To be honest, some of my best
memory training sessions have come straight after a
satisfying workout. In addition to health benefits, getting a
workout in also clears my mind. Whether I’m going for that
casual jog or exerting myself to the max with a CrossFit
workout, those moments (fifteen minutes, thirty minutes, an
hour, whatever!) allow me to reflect on whatever is on my
mind. It’s a time for my mind to dump all the stress and
superfluous thoughts that have been running rampant on
that particular day. When I come back from my workout and
sit down to do some work, I find it easier to focus and
process the task at hand without distraction. It’s like an
automatic mental distraction-purging system. So get
moving! There’s no need to get intense with your workouts
(although it doesn’t hurt if you can); just doing something
active on a regular basis will work wonders.‡

### HANGING OUT WITH THE JONESES

##### TIPS FOR IMPROVING MEMORY BY BEING SOCIALLY

##### ACTIVE

It’s a sad truth, but loneliness has been shown to lead to
higher blood pressure and higher levels of stress^12 —and it’s
not hard to imagine why. In one of her studies, Harvard
epidemiologist Lisa Berkman surveyed seven thousand
people on their levels of social integration over time, and
discovered that those who scored low on those measures
were 2 to 2.5 times more likely than average to die over a
seven-year period.
While social interaction certainly boosts quality of life, it
can boost other things too: Elderly women with larger social
networks have been found to be less susceptible to
dementia than their less-connected peers.^13 On a more basic
level, socializing involves learning new things about
different people and retaining that information in order to
interact comfortably with them. Whether that means
knowing the details of their life stories and their interests or
simply how to hold a conversation without pissing them off,
it’s a way to broaden your mental frame of reference so you
have more associations to help you remember. And of
course, at the very least, meeting new people is a great way
to practice your newfound names-and-faces memory skills.

### ALL ABOARD THE BRAIN TRAIN

##### TIPS FOR IMPROVING MEMORY BY USING YOUR BRAIN

#### I’m going to do today what other people aren’t willing

#### to, so I can do tomorrow what other people can’t.

##### —SOMEONE WHO KNOWS WHAT SHE’S TALKING ABOUT

#### As important as diet, sleep, exercise, and social

#### activity are to maximizing your memory, the biggest

#### booster of all is keeping your brain active. What does

that mean? Simply put, it means challenging your brain—

#### and this is key—on a regular basis. It can be as simple as

trying a new language, reading something new and difficult,
learning a new skill, doing puzzles, or (my personal favorite,
of course) memorizing. Even when I’ve been high up on a
mountain, my body physically distressed and social
interactions totally out the window, I was still able to use
some of my memory techniques to memorize a deck of
cards in the Death Zone§ on Mount Everest as well as on the
summit of Mount Kilimanjaro (true story!). In other words, I
was still able to improve my memory, using the pure power
of technique. Part of it can be attributed to all the training I
had put in well before. But a large part of it was due to the
techniques themselves.

```
A big part of keeping your brain active on a daily basis,
```

#### though, is staying motivated to do so. One of the most

common questions I get about my memory skills is “Do you

#### really think anyone can do this, or do you have a gift?” and

my answer is always “No, anyone can do it.” This is mostly

#### true, with one little caveat: Anyone can do it, provided he

#### has the drive to do it. But this is true with any skill, more or

less. We all have the potential to practice something a lot,
but what we don’t all have is the drive and dedication
necessary to do that practice every day. And that’s fine.
Look, I would love to be an expert jazz trumpet player, but I
don’t think I have the drive and dedication to practice that
every day and become an expert jazz trumpet player. My
point is this: Keep your brain active by doing something you
are passionate about enough to do it every day. For some,
this might be memorizing something (like me), for others, it
might be learning a new skill or language; for still others it
might be practicing a new baking recipe—the list goes on.
The great thing about memory is that there are tons of daily
uses where you can naturally practice without having to set

aside time to do it. So make memory your daily brain
exercise or make it something else, it’s up to you! Just make
sure you challenge your brain in some way every day.

#### Before we finish, let me remind you one last time: Trust

#### your memory. That’s what really sets apart the best

memorizers from the rest of the pack, when it comes down
to it. When you trust your memory, you begin to build
confidence in your memory. And when you have confidence
in your brain and your mnemonic powers, you will be

#### unstoppable; your progress toward an unstoppable memory

will be unstoppable. And to get to a point where you can
trust your memory completely, you need to train. It all
comes full circle. There are no shortcuts to this; it’s like any
other skill. Think of Ray Allen in Game Six of the 2013 NBA
Finals: He gets a pass from Chris Bosh with five seconds left
in the game, and without thinking about it, he catches and
shoots from the tiniest space in the corner of the court.

#### SWISH. The game is tied, it goes into overtime, and the

Miami Heat prevails with one of the most crucial victories in
the history of the franchise. Do you think Ray Allen would’ve
been able to make such a high-stakes shot if he hadn’t been
practicing three-pointers his whole life? He’s shot them so
many times in so many different situations and under
varying levels of pressure that he doesn’t think about how

#### to do it; he just does. What this comes down to is the trust

and confidence he built inside his mind from all of that
training and practice, the thousands of hours spent alone in
the gym firing threes.
Even if you’re not trying to become one of the best
memorizers the world has ever seen, you’ll still want to
cultivate something close to what Ray Allen and other clutch
performers have: a feeling of flow, confidence, and ease,
which in our case pertains to memorizing. Don’t worry—you
don’t need ten thousand hours of practice (as Malcolm

#### Gladwell posits in his book Outliers) to master your memory.

In many ways, you’ve already spent far more than ten
thousand hours working on your memory before you even
picked up this book. All you needed was a little instruction
to take things a bit further and harness two of your most
sharply tuned skills: visualization and spatial recognition.
What you need to get to that point of supreme confidence is
your own daily training regimen: something consistent to
keep those memory wheels turning. If you need a bit of help
setting this up, flip to the appendix (this page).

### FAREWELL AND GOOD LUCK!

With that, I bid thee farewell!
In general, as with all the other techniques in this book,
you’ll find that as you start implementing them in the most
obvious areas of your life (like the ones I’m specifically
suggesting), you’ll see more and more opportunities to use
them in other ways. Although you can do some clever little
parlor tricks with your newfound skills, you’re primarily
stocking your mental utility belt in order to remember the
things that matter. The more you put each of these tools to
use, the more you’ll find it to be an endless Swiss Army
knife of possibilities.

```
I hope this book has been a great help in making you
```

#### realize how good your memory actually is (better than you

initially thought, I bet, huh?) and that with a little bit of
strategy and technique, your memory can be a real
powerhouse.
If you only walk away with one concept from this book, I
hope it is **SEE–LINK–GO!** Whenever you’re faced with a
memory-related task, breathe, take a moment, and go
through those three familiar steps. **SEE** the thing you’re
trying to memorize as an image; give it life, give it color.
**LINK** that image (or sequence of images) to something you
already know; anchor it to that thought, that peg, that

location on your memory journey. And finally, make sure
that you really **GO!** and mesh all those pieces together into
one memorable image that is totally, unequivocally
impossible to forget. Don’t forget to trust your memory and
remember to pay attention. Keep all of that in the front of
your mind and no matter what it is that you’re trying to

#### memorize, you will Remember It!

  with some mental exercise? While exerting yourself physically try
  simultaneously memorizing a list or recalling something you recently
  learned.

# APPENDIX

In the pages to follow you’ll find information on my training
regimen, a list of helpful sources, and plenty of memory

the appendix for “full lists” or “example lists” of my own.
Here they are, in case you need a little help getting started!

### ALPHABET PEG LIST

Here are two examples of my Alphabet Peg Lists. I have one

### PAO LIST FOR NUMBERS (00-99)

Here is my original two-digit number system. I have now
grown this to a three-digit system, but this is the original list
I created back in 2008, sitting on my couch in Chicago. As
you’ll see, some are based on intuitive associations, while
others strictly follow the PAO System rules. Finally, some
stragglers have no real reason for being a certain number
(you’ll see them marked with ??); they were born of a need
to associate a person important to me with a number.
Apologies to the ex-girlfriends included here; all remain
memorable to me (in both good and bad ways). Hey,
sometimes you gotta keep the bad and the good just to
benefit your memory, right?
One last thing to stress about this list: Please try to come
up with your own images. I’m sharing mine to help inspire
you; nothing will beat the memorableness of a list you
create yourself. Firstly, the images you think of will be more
meaningful to you. Secondly, the painstaking process of

coming up with one hundred images, in itself, will make the
images more memorable to you.

#### PASSWORD SYMBOL IMAGES

#### (ALSO FOR POEMS/TEXTS)

You’re having trouble with thinking of people/aetions/objeets
for the random symbols in your password, right? No worries,
here are my go-to images. I also use these to remember

punctuation marks in poems (for when I have to write them
out perfectly [see this page]). Most of these eome from
what I feel is right, others kind of look like the image. Also, I
don’t use a person for this kind of memory task, as it’s too
arbitrary—so only an action and an object. In chapter 5 (this
page), we just made them up as we went along. That works
too—but if you’re worried about misinterpreting your
password, go and memorize these (or your own).

### COMMON WORD LIST IMAGES FOR

### POEMS/TEXTS

Here are words that will often come up in text
memorization. These words alone don’t really mean much,
so they can be tricky when trying to infuse them with a fun,
memorable picture. See this page for some examples of
how to put this to use.

```

### RESOURCES

If your first resource is this book (and may I say you’ve
made a mighty fine choice), here are others that will help
you along further.

I mainly use three particular websites for training: **1. Art of
Memory** —A website that really has it all: a vast wiki of all
memory techniques, tutorials, an incredibly useful forum to
share ideas and pose questions, as well as some great
training software and games (www.artofmemory.com).

**2. Memocamp** —A website designed specifically for
memory athletes looking for all the competition events in
one place. It’s based off a level earning system, so you
start off simple; as you improve, you can unlock
increasingly more difficult challenges
(www.memocamp.com).

**3. Memrise** —A website aimed primarily at (but not limited
to) memorizing vocabulary in any language. It reminds
you when you need to review and provides lovely
mnemonics for every word you learn
(www.memrise.com).

Other websites/tools I recommend:

**1. Anki** —Anki is a spaced repetition flashcard program. It
helps you organize information you’re trying to learn as
flashcards and then reminds you when it’s time to review.
It can be downloaded as a smartphone app to help you
on the go (https://apps.ankiweb.net).
**2. Memoriad** —Memoriad is another memory competition
that takes place every so often, and it uses some great
software. You can download the software for free and use
it to train on numbers, cards, names, and binary
numbers. The names and faces are limited, though
(www.memoriad.com).
**3. Memory League** —A website I cocreated that allows you
to train your memory by competing against others in
short memory matches online. Super addictive
(http://app.memoryleague.com)!
**4. My website** —Check out [http://www.nelsondellis.com](http://www.nelsondellis.com) for more
tips and great video tutorials. I’ve also created some files
for you that will help you generate practice sets for
memorizing different kinds of information as well as
templates for building out some of your more complex
memory systems. You can find those all at
[http://www.nelsondellls.com/sample-sheets.](http://www.nelsondellls.com/sample-sheets.)

You don’t even need an Internet connection to practice with
these: **1. Playing Cards** —I will rant and rave until I’m blue
In the face about how great a daily exercise this is.
Everyone has a deck of cards and they’re easy to transport.
Get on this!

**2. Yearbooks** —You can always find these at your school,
online, at thrift stores everywhere. These are fantastic for
practicing names and faces.
**3. License Plates** —Most of us are on the roads every
morning and evening commuting to and from work. To
practice numbers on the go, just look at the cars around
you and memorize license plates. If you don’t drive, try
to look for other numbers out in the wild (most subway
cars have an identification number somewhere, for
example).

### YOUR TRAINING REGIMEN

It makes sense that, after sharing a whole book of memory
tips, I offer some kind of training regimen for those who
might want to go above and beyond memorizing everyday
things. I personally train every single day. But then again, I
train to win memory competitions. I’m not asking you to
spend hours the way I do. Fifteen to twenty minutes a day
(spread out through the day if you’d like) is all you need to
see some serious, life-changing memory improvements.

The tough thing about training your memory is that there
is no simple way to train intensively on the types of things
you might need to memorize in everyday life. Are you going
to pick random people off the street and ask them to throw
their phone numbers at you or give you a list of random
talking points for a theoretical speech? Rather, I recommend
focusing on four of the memory disciplines that appear in
memory competitions. These exercises will cover everything
you could ever need—directly, in terms of information, or
indirectly, in terms of your **SEE** – **LINK** – **GO!** skills. All these
disciplines are great exercises to do daily, because they’re
easily measured with some simple day-to-day analysis of
performance (speed, volume, and accuracy). And even
though they may not be exactly what you’re looking for,
they will help hone your memory skills in general—which

will, in turn, help you get faster and more confident when it
comes to memorizing in real life.

**1. Cards** —We went through the progression of how to nail
your first deck of cards in chapter 6 (this page). The first
time you did it probably took you twenty minutes or so,
but don’t worry, that time quickly goes down. And while
memorizing one deck of cards as your practice for the
day may not feel like much, trust me when I say that

#### there is nothing better for training your brain than this.

**2. Names** —Probably one of the more useful skills that apply
to real life. I mentioned a few resources on this page that
you can use to practice. Choose one and start practicing.
**3. Numbers** —You can find numbers everywhere, so training
just depends on what you’re interested in doing with
them. Do you want to memorize a huge number? Or just
your phone numbers? Gather some numbers relevant to
you and get started.
**4. Words** —This is another highly relevant discipline to train.
Think of it like memorizing your to-do or grocery list.
Generate a list of random words using one of the
resources below and get going!

The key to training in all these disciplines is to choose a
fixed amount of material (start small and work your way up
as you feel more comfortable). And—even more important—
time yourself! You can either measure how long it takes to
complete the memorization or give yourself a time limit and
see how much you can memorize in that time. Just choose
one structure and stick with it.
The next thing you need to do is to KEEP NOTES. You
can’t get better unless you practice with immediate
feedback. Keep a journal of your daily performances in all
the disciplines. It will make you push yourself every day to
get faster and more accurate.

### PAO LIST FOR CARDS

Here you have my personal list of PAO for all fifty-two
playing cards. Keep in mind that the face cards’ images
were determined by how they felt to me at the time; most of
the number cards were decided by using the PAO System.
Others were based on some category for the suit when I had
no other option or felt like the image I had was not a great
one (e.g., hearts = loved ones. I replaced the PAO
numbering system with friends and family to represent any
card with a heart on it as that was more memorable for me).
You’ll also notice that I sometimes use the translation from
letters to number, then use the PAO I have from my number
system (e.g., 2 of diamonds = BD or 24 = Kobe Bryant [his
jersey number]). In brief, a lot of this list has been morphed
over time to fit what felt most intuitive for me. I encourage
you to do the same!

# ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

This book has been a memorable journey in itself. Ever since

#### Joshua Foer encouraged me to write the perfect how-to

#### memory book to accompany his bestseller Moonwalking

#### with Einstein, I’ve been motivated to see this book through.

Through all the ups and downs over the years writing,
rewriting, pitching, getting offers, losing offers, and
rejections, I’m so thankful to all the people in my life who
hung on and helped me get to the end.

Thanks to my loving wife, Leah, who helped give me clarity
on my writing and the project as a whole. I spent some long
nights writing and editing, and she was always there to
support me. I love you!

Thank you to my agent, Jim Levine, for never giving up on
this project. He loved the book from the very start and
never gave up on pitching it (I think we pretty much pitched
to everyone in the literary world).

Thank you to the incredible team at Abrams, who decided to
give this book a shot. A huge thank you to my editor, Laura
Dozier, for being on the same wavelength as me about what
this book should be and for taking all my crazy book-related
ideas in stride. You turned an okay book into an absolutely
AWESOME book. Thank you. Thank you to the rest of the
team who helped design, illustrate, promote, sell,
brainstorm, proofread, ALL THE THINGS! You guys were
indispensable!

Lastly, thank you to my family and my close friends for
being a part of my life (and my memories). Without you,
none of my memory techniques would be so memorable.
They are entirely made up of all of you!
